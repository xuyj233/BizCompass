In a standard Cox partial likelihood, the denominator at each event time includes ALL subjects still at risk.

Therefore, Prentice's method modifies the risk set to include only those with observed covariates.\n\n**Option B**: The summation is over $\\mathcal{C}$ (case-cohort sample).\n\nThis is true but not the distinguishing feature.

In this situation, which test statistic would likely be the most powerful, and why?", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "Looking at this problem, I need to analyze which test statistic would be most powerful when the LM_T(π) function has a single, sharp, high peak around π = 0.7 and is close to zero elsewhere.\n\nThe key insight is understanding how these two test statistics work:\n- The sup LM test takes the maximum value of LM_T(π) over all π\n- The Exp-LM_0T test averages LM_T(π) over all π\n\nGiven the scenario where LM_T(π) has a sharp peak at π ≈ 0.7 and is near zero elsewhere:\n\nFor the sup LM test:\n- It will capture the full height of the peak at π = 0.7\n- This gives the maximum evidence against the null hypothesis\n\nFor the Exp-LM_0T test:\n- It averages the high value at π = 0.7 with many near-zero values elsewhere\n- This dilutes the strong evidence concentrated at the peak\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\nOption A correctly identifies that sup LM is designed to detect concentrated evidence and that averaging would dilute it.\n\nOption B is incorrect - while Exp-LM_0T may be more robust in general settings, it's not optimal when evidence is concentrated at a single point.\n\nOption C makes an incorrect argument - while mathematically true that sup ≥ average, this doesn't guarantee higher power because the test statistics have different distributions under the null.\n\nOption D incorrectly assumes the peak is due to noise.

The combinatorial term `Σ_i ln(binom(m_i, x_i))` doesn't depend on α, so it doesn't affect concavity with respect to α.\n\n2. The term `Σ_i Σ_j Σ_k ln(α_j + k)` involves ln(α_j + k) for each j. Since ln(y) is concave, and we're summing concave functions, this term is concave in α.\n\n3. The term `-Σ_i Σ_k ln(|α| + k)` where |α| = Σ_j α_j is the problematic one.\n\nLet me examine why this term causes non-concavity:\n- This term equals -Σ_i Σ_k ln(Σ_j α_j + k)\n- We have a composition: -ln(g(α)) where g(α) = Σ_j α_j + k\n- The function -ln(y) is convex in y\n- The function g(α) = Σ_j α_j + k is linear (affine) in α\n- When composing a convex function with a linear function, we get a convex function\n- So -ln(|α| + k) is convex in α\n\nSince the log-likelihood contains both concave terms (from ln(α_j + k)) and convex terms (from -ln(|α| + k)), the overall function is neither concave nor convex - it's non-concave.\n\nOption A correctly identifies both the term and the mathematical reason: the term `-Σ_i Σ_k ln(|α|+k)` is responsible because `-ln(y)` is convex, making its contribution to the Hessian positive semi-definite (which opposes the negative semi-definite contribution needed for concavity).\n\nA", "model_answer": "A", "error": null}, "Options": {"A": "The term `-Σ_i Σ_k ln(|α|+k)`, because the function `-ln(y)` is convex, and its Hessian contribution is a positive semi-definite matrix.", "B": "The term `Σ_i Σ_j Σ_k ln(α_j+k)`, because the `ln(y)` function is concave, which makes the overall function non-concave.", "C": "The term `-Σ_i Σ_k ln(|α|+k)`, because the sum over `i` observations introduces complex dependencies that prevent concavity.", "D": "The term `Σ_i ln(binom(m_i, x_i))`, because the combinatorial term is a non-linear function of the data, which induces non-concavity in the parameters."}}

The focus is on understanding their definitions, computational complexity, and statistical properties like invariance and robustness.\n\nWe have an i.i.d. sample `X_1, ..., X_n` from a distribution `P` on `R^k`, where `k` can be large.

Projection Depth (PD):** This approach first defines an 'outlyingness' measure. For each direction `u`, the data is projected onto the line spanned by `u`. The outlyingness of `x` is its maximum standardized distance to the center over all possible projections:\n\n```latex\n\\mathrm{OU}_{n}(x) = \\sup_{||u||=1} \\frac{|\\langle x, u \\rangle - \\mu_{\\aleph_{n,u}}|}{\\tau_{\\aleph_{n,u}}} \\quad \\text{(Eq.
