{"ID": 466, "Question": "### Background\n\nThis paper proposes a statistical model for registering 3D brain images by maximizing a composite likelihood. The model partitions the brain image into distinct regions and assumes different probability distributions for voxel values in each region to achieve both robust and precise alignment. The goal is to estimate registration parameters `$\\phi$` that align the image to a standard coordinate system.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nFor each pair of voxels `$(Y_s, Y_{s'})$` reflected across a candidate midline plane, the values are transformed into a difference component, `$U_s = (Y_s - Y_{s'})/2$`, and an average component, `$V_s = (Y_s + Y_{s'})/2$`. The model is constructed as follows:\n\n1.  **Midline Region (`$\\mathcal{M}$`):** To robustly find the plane of symmetry, the difference values `u_s` are modeled with a weighted Laplace (double exponential) distribution, which assumes `$\\mathbb{E}[U_s] = 0$`. The density is `$f(u_s) = \\frac{\\psi w_s}{2} \\exp(-\\psi w_s |u_s|)$`.\n2.  **Landmark Regions (`$\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{P}$`):** To precisely locate key anatomical landmarks (AC and PC), the average values `v_s` in these regions are modeled as independently Normal, matching them to a known template: `$\\beta v_s + \\gamma \\sim N(\\mu_s, \\sigma_s^2/w_s)$`.\n\nThe full log-likelihood is the sum of terms from these regions:\n\n```latex\n\\log L(\\phi, \\dots) = \\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{M}}\\left\\{\\log\\left(\\frac{\\psi w_{s}}{2}\\right)-\\psi w_{s}|u_{s}|\\right\\} + \\sum_{s\\in\\mathcal{A} \\cup \\mathcal{P}} \\left\\{ \\dots -\\frac{w_{s}}{2\\sigma_{s}^{2}}(\\beta v_{s}+\\gamma-\\mu_{s})^{2}\\right\\} + \\dots\n\\quad \\text{(Eq.

{"ID": 467, "Question": "### Background\n\nIn neuroimaging studies, researchers often perform hypothesis tests at thousands of locations simultaneously, creating a massive multiple testing problem. This paper analyzes group differences in brain shape by computing a `t`-statistic at each of `k=62501` locations on a hemisphere. These statistics form a smooth random field. To control the family-wise error rate (FWER), the probability of making one or more false discoveries, the paper uses Random Field Theory (RFT).\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nUnder the null hypothesis of no group difference, the `t`-statistics form a smooth, stationary, isotropic Student's `t` random field on a hemisphere with `$\\nu=64$` degrees of freedom. RFT provides an approximation for the FWER-corrected `p`-value, i.e., the probability that the maximum of the entire field, `T_max`, exceeds a high threshold `z`:\n\n```latex\nP(T_{\\mathrm{max}}>z) \\approx \\rho_{0}(z)+\\pi\\rho_{1}(z)+2\\pi\\rho_{2}(z)\n\\quad \\text{(Eq. (1))}\n```\n\nwhere the components depend on `z`, `$\\nu$`, and the field's estimated roughness `$\\lambda$` (a measure of spatial correlation). The paper reports a corrected `p`-value of 0.065 for a threshold of `z=3` with `$\\hat{\\lambda}=3$`, and concludes there is \"weak evidence\" for a group difference.\n\nThe paper uses Random Field Theory (RFT) instead of a Bonferroni correction and reports a corrected `p`-value of 0.065. Which of the following statements provides the most accurate rationale for this choice and the correct interpretation of the result?", "Options": {"A": "RFT is used because the `t`-statistics are spatially correlated; it leverages this smoothness to provide a more powerful test than the overly conservative Bonferroni correction. The `p`-value of 0.065 represents the family-wise error rate (FWER).", "B": "RFT is necessary because the number of tests (`k=62501`) is large. The `p`-value of 0.065 means that 6.5% of the locations with `t>3` are expected to be false positives.", "C": "RFT is more conservative than Bonferroni because it accounts for the roughness `$\\lambda$`. The `p`-value of 0.065 is the probability of observing a `t`-statistic greater than 3 at any single, pre-specified location.", "D": "RFT is used because the data follows a Student's `t` distribution.
