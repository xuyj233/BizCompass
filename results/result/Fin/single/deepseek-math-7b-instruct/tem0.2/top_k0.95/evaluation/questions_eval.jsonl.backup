In a crisis, the agent must choose an action that affects firm value.\n\n**Variables and Parameters.**\n- `S`: State of the world, `S ∈ {Routine, Crisis}`.\n- `p`: Probability of the Crisis state, `Pr(S=Crisis) = p`.\n- `a`: Agent's action choice in the Crisis state, `a ∈ {a_1, a_2}`.\n- `V(a, S)`: Firm value, which depends on the action and state.\n- `P`: Private benefit to the agent from taking a specific action (monetary units).\n- `B`: Non-pecuniary benefit from adhering to the firm's cultural norm (utility units).\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nAt `t=0`, a contract is signed. At `t=1`, the state `S` is realized.\n\n-   **Routine State (Prob 1-p):** This state is contractible. The contract specifies an action `a_R` and a wage, leading to a known value `V_R`.\n-   **Crisis State (Prob p):** This state is non-contractible. The agent receives a fixed salary and is free to choose an action `a ∈ {a_1, a_2}`.\n    -   **Action `a_1` (Self-serving):** The agent receives a private benefit `P > 0`. This action leads to a low firm value, `V(a_1, Crisis) = V_L`.\n    -   **Action `a_2` (Firm-serving):** The agent receives no private benefit. This action is costly in opportunity terms but is better for the firm, yielding a high firm value, `V(a_2, Crisis) = V_H`, where `V_H > V_L`.\n\nPeshawaria's “articulate, socialize, reinforce” process creates a shared norm. We model this as a non-pecuniary utility benefit `B ≥ 0` that the agent receives if and only if they choose the culturally appropriate (firm-serving) action `a_2` in a crisis. The magnitude of `B` represents the strength of the corporate culture.\n\n---\n\n### The Question\n\nAccording to the model, in which of the following scenarios would a strong corporate culture be most financially valuable to a firm?", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "", "model_answer": "Error_Upstream_Exception", "error": "Error: API调用异常 (可能是上游问题): Error code: 403 - {'error': {'message': '当前分组 [DeepSeek] 下对于模型 deepseek-math-7b-instruct 暂无可用渠道 (request id: 202509102331221726339352254858)', 'type': 'v_api_error'}}"}}

The components are defined as:\n\n```latex\n\\Omega = \\frac{N-1}{N^2}\\sum_{i=1}^N \\mathrm{cov}(\\varepsilon_{i,t},\\varepsilon_{i,t-1}) \\tag{3}\n```\n\n```latex\n\\delta = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^N (b_{0,i}-\\bar{b}_{0})(b_{1,i}-\\bar{b}_{1}) \\tag{4}\n```\n\nEmpirical estimates of this decomposition were performed on 20 industry portfolios for two sample periods, using the value-weighted CRSP index as the common factor.

The key empirical challenge is that firm profitability, stock returns, and market-to-book ratios are often correlated, making it difficult to isolate the true driver of SEO timing.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe duration model estimates the effect of covariates on the time until an SEO. The model's interpretation rule is: *\"a significantly positive (negative) sign suggests that the variable is positively (negatively) related to the duration, but negatively (positively) related to the hazard probability and the probability of equity financing.\"* A negative coefficient thus implies a shorter time to an SEO and a higher probability of issuance.\n\nTwo primary hypotheses are considered:\n1.  **Market Timing Hypothesis:** Managers opportunistically issue equity when they perceive their stock is overvalued, as proxied by a high Market-to-Book (`M/B`) ratio or high recent `Stock returns`.\n2.  **Regulatory Pressure Hypothesis:** The Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) requires firms to meet a minimum Return on Equity (`ROE`) to qualify for an SEO. This creates a powerful incentive for firms to report high profitability (`ROA` is used as a proxy) immediately before an issuance.\n\nTable 1 presents results from models testing the market timing hypothesis in isolation.

The model's interpretation rule is: *\"a significantly positive (negative) sign suggests that the variable is positively (negatively) related to the duration, but negatively (positively) related to the hazard probability and the probability of equity financing.\"* A negative coefficient thus implies a shorter time to an SEO and a higher probability of issuance.\n\nTwo primary hypotheses are considered:\n1.  **Market Timing Hypothesis:** Managers opportunistically issue equity when they perceive their stock is overvalued, as proxied by a high Market-to-Book (`M/B`) ratio or high recent `Stock returns`.\n2.  **Regulatory Pressure Hypothesis:** The Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) requires firms to meet a minimum Return on Equity (`ROE`) to qualify for an SEO. This creates a powerful incentive for firms to report high profitability (`ROA` is used as a proxy) immediately before an issuance.\n\nTable 1 presents results from models testing the market timing hypothesis in isolation. Table 2 presents results from a multivariate \"horse race\" regression that includes both a profitability measure (`ROA`) and a market timing measure (`M/B` ratio) to see which has more explanatory power.\n\n**Table 1: Duration Analysis of Market Timing**\n\n| Variable | Model (1) Coeff.

Market participants widely believe this creates a strong \"implicit guarantee\" from the central government for LGFV debt, meaning the state would intervene to prevent a default.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe yield on an LGFV bond can be modeled as:\n```latex\nY_{LGFV} = Y_{RF} + S_C + S_I \n```\nwhere `Y_RF` is the risk-free rate, `S_C` is the credit spread for a comparable private corporation, and `S_I` is the spread component reflecting the implicit guarantee. Because the guarantee reduces risk, `S_I` is negative.\n\nThe percentage price change of a bond for a small change in yield (`ΔY`) can be approximated by `ΔP/P ≈ -D × ΔY`, where `D` is the bond's modified duration.\n\n### Question\n\nConsider a portfolio of LGFV bonds with an average duration (`D`) of 5 years. The average credit spread for comparable private corporations (`S_C`) is 2.0% (200 basis points).

This hypothesis predicts that buybacks should be concentrated in value firms (high Book-to-Market ratios).\n*   **Risk-Change Hypothesis:** The abnormal returns are not due to general mispricing but to the market's slow recognition of a fundamental reduction in the firm's risk (systematic or total) as it matures and exercises growth options.\n\n**Setting / Data-Generating Environment.** The analysis covers U.S. share repurchase announcements from 1994–2014, split into two key subperiods for comparison: 1994–2001 and 2002–2006.

Use the estimated coefficients `hat(γ)_0` and `hat(γ)_1` to calculate the nondiscretionary current accruals (`NDCA`) for each sample firm `i`:\n    ```latex\n    NDCA_{it} = \\hat{\\gamma}_0 \\frac{1}{TA_{i,t-1}} + \\hat{\\gamma}_1 \\frac{\\Delta Sales_{it} - \\Delta AR_{it}}{TA_{i,t-1}} \\quad \\text{(Eq.

{"ID": 355, "Question": "### Background\n\n**Research Question.** How does the competitive entry of speculative traders shape market stability and efficiency, and can it lead to socially excessive volatility? What are the implications for financial regulation?\n\n**Setting.** A key finding of the model is that the interaction between firms' entry decisions and the price-setting mechanism can generate multiple equilibria.
