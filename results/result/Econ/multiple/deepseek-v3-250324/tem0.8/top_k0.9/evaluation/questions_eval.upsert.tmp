Strategy: Atomic Decomposition. The original QA problem's core result is split into independently verifiable statements about the output ratio (A) and the condition for specialization (B). Distractor Logic: (C) is a Conceptual Opposite, ignoring the inequality/corner solution in the equilibrium condition (Eq. 1). (D) is Almost Right; the gain depends on `I`, but the reason is the non-rival nature of technology capital, not increasing returns to scale in the production function (which is CRS).", "qid": "7", "question": "### Background\n\n**Research Question.** This problem examines the equilibrium determination of technology capital stocks and the resulting specialization patterns, focusing on why smaller or later-opening countries might optimally choose to produce no technology capital of their own.\n\n**Setting.** In a multi-country world, each country `i` endogenously chooses its stock of technology capital, `M_i`. The equilibrium is characterized by a no-arbitrage condition: the total return on `M_i` must equal its user cost. This framework is used to analyze a scenario where one country unilaterally opens to a world of `I` closed, identical countries.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe total world return on country `i`'s technology capital is the sum of its marginal products in all countries `j` where it can be used:\n  \nr_i(M) = \\sum_{j=1}^I \\frac{\\partial F_j}{\\partial M_i}\n \nThe steady-state equilibrium for `M` is defined by the complementary slackness conditions:\n  \nr_i(M) \\le \\rho + \\delta_m, \\quad \\text{with equality if } M_i > 0 \\quad \\text{(Eq. (1))}\n \nwhere `\\rho + \\delta_m` is the user cost of technology capital.\n\nFor a set of identical countries, the steady-state output can be expressed as:\n  \nY_i = \\psi (AN)_i \\left( M_i + \\omega_i \\sum_{j \\ne i} M_j \\right)^{\\phi / (1 - \\alpha(1-\\phi))}\n \nwhere `psi` is a constant incorporating underlying parameters.\n\n### Question\n\nConsider a world of `I+1` identical countries. One country (`o`) unilaterally becomes fully open (`omega_o=1`), while the other `I` countries (`c`) remain closed (`omega_c=0`). The open country finds it optimal to set its own technology capital to zero (`M_o=0`) and rely on FDI from the `I` closed countries.
