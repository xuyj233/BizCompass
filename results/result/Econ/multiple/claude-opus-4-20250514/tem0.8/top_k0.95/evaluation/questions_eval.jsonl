However, they converge to pseudo-true values that are compatible with the imposed restriction, ensuring the bootstrap DGP maintains exactly p-r unit roots as required.\n\n**Statement C**: This accurately captures why the proposed method is robust. By estimating all parameters under the same hypothesis H(r), the method ensures internal consistency. The parameters work together to preserve the stability properties (I(1,r) conditions) required by the null hypothesis.\n\n**Statement D**: This is incorrect. While Swensen's method uses consistent short-run estimates, this doesn't guarantee more power. In fact, the paper likely argues that violating the I(1,r) conditions (as Swensen's method risks doing) can lead to size distortions and invalid inference, not necessarily more power.\n\nA,B,C", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

Each regulator seeks to maximize the welfare of consumers only during their own tenure. The firm is long-lived and maximizes the discounted sum of its profits.\n\nThe core friction arises because key state variables—a technology parameter `θ` that affects benefits in both periods, and an idiosyncratic first-period shock `ε`—are observable to the regulators and the firm, but are not verifiable by a third party (e.g., a court).

Even with improved test scores, they still wouldn't meet college requirements or consider college as an option. This is a plausible explanation for why academic gains didn't translate to enrollment gains.\n\n**Option B**: This focuses on the disruption of local connections between Orleans high schools and nearby colleges (especially community colleges like Delgado). Since 66% of Orleans students at two-year colleges went to the local Delgado Community College, losing these established pathways and support networks could significantly impact enrollment decisions. This is highly plausible.\n\n**Option C**: This suggests evacuees moved to areas with poor job markets, leading them to work instead of attending college. However, this doesn't align with typical economic behavior - poor job markets usually increase college enrollment as an alternative to unemployment, not decrease it. This explanation is implausible.\n\n**Option D**: Given that the overall college enrollment dropped by 4.2 percentage points and that Orleans students heavily relied on local two-year colleges (66% went to Delgado), a reduction in two-year college enrollment could indeed drive the overall negative effect.

The wife's reservation wage (w_f*) is the shadow price of her time, determined by the household's optimization problem. With non-separable preferences, this shadow price will depend on other variables including the husband's wage, as his labor supply decisions affect the marginal value of her non-market time.\n\nD) This is correct. When the wife participates, her labor supply enters the household's budget constraint with the market wage. When she doesn't participate, the constraint involves her reservation wage instead. This fundamental difference in constraints, combined with non-separable preferences, means the husband's labor supply function will have different functional forms in the two regimes.\n\nC,D", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

Since this outcome is strictly worse than any f-optimal outcome, it can never be a best response when an f-optimal outcome is available. This makes Condition μ2(iv) satisfied vacuously - there's no need to check if the bad outcome could be a best response because by construction it cannot be. This is correct.\n\n**Statement B**: RVP (Restricted Veto Power) requires that when two agents disagree on the best outcome, there exists an outcome that neither wants to veto. This is actually a weaker condition than NVP (No Veto Power), which requires that an individual agent cannot unilaterally veto any outcome. The statement claims RVP is stronger, which is incorrect.\n\n**Statement C**: NLI is specifically a condition for the 'Economic Environment' approach, not the 'Bad Outcome' approach. The bad outcome approach uses RVP, not NLI. This statement incorrectly claims both approaches require NLI. This is incorrect.\n\n**Statement D**: Under the 'Economic Environment' approach with Assumption E, when we select an outcome from a strict lower contour set (something strictly worse than an f-optimal outcome), this outcome cannot be a maximal element in the agent's preference ordering. Therefore, like in the bad outcome approach, Condition μ2(iv) is satisfied vacuously - we don't need to verify it can't be a best response because by construction (being in a strict lower contour set) it cannot be.

This is indeed endogenous - past consumption (q_{i,t-1}) directly affects current consumption. When permanent price changes occur, consumers will gradually adjust their consumption patterns, and these new patterns will feed back through the habit formation mechanism. This makes the LESH model theoretically more suitable for capturing how behavior evolves in response to structural changes.\n\n**Option B**: This is the Lucas critique in action. Just because the RDI model had better historical predictive performance (32 vs 41) doesn't mean it will perform better under a structural policy change. The parameters estimated from historical data may not remain stable when the policy environment fundamentally changes.\n\n**Option C**: This is clearly false. Good historical performance doesn't guarantee that either model has captured the \"true underlying structure\" of preferences, especially when facing a structural break.\n\n**Option D**: The RDI model's dynamics come from an autonomous trend term (κ_i) that is essentially a fixed time trend estimated from historical data. This trend cannot adapt to new economic conditions created by the tax reform. For a structural policy change, this makes the RDI model problematic because its key dynamic component remains fixed based on pre-reform patterns.\n\nTherefore, the valid considerations are A and D.\n\nA,D", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

The buyer can use a 'punishment' scoring rule, such as `S(p,Q) = v(Q_min) - p` if `Q = Q_min` and `S(p,Q) = -∞` otherwise.

A specific functional form is the additively separable case:\n  \nV(p) = h(κ·p) + σ(p) \nEq. (1)\n \nwhere `h` is a strictly increasing function and `σ(p)` is a strictly quasi-concave function representing the fairness of the allocation procedure `p`.\n\n**Model 2 (Neoclassical Self-Interest).** The agent's utility depends only on their own probability of winning, `p_A`. The utility function is:\n  \nU(p) = p_A \nEq. (2)\n \nIn the experiment, subjects choose a lottery from a set represented by a line segment, `p(λ) = λp¹ + (1-λ)p²` for `λ ∈ [0,1]`, where `p¹` and `p²` are endpoint lotteries.\n\n### Question\n\nBased on the theoretical models and the experimental design described, select ALL statements that are logically correct.", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "Looking at each statement:\n\nA) **TRUE**.

The model doesn't guarantee interior solutions for all agents with non-zero fairness concerns.

This allows each series to be scaled according to its own integration order estimate.\n\n**B) To resolve ambiguity when `X^*` rejects and `X^{**}` does not, a valid diagnostic procedure is to perform a formal hypothesis test on the equality of the univariate integration order estimates (e.g., `H_0: \\delta_1 = \\delta_2`).**\n\nThis is correct. When `X^*` rejects but `X^{**}` does not, it suggests the rejection may be due to heterogeneous integration orders rather than true cointegration. Testing the equality of integration orders would help diagnose whether this is the case.\n\n**C) The `X^{**}` test is robust but generally less powerful than `X^*` when the assumption of equal integration orders holds, as `X^*` more efficiently uses the information under that specific null.**\n\nThis is correct. When the assumption of equal integration orders is satisfied, `X^*` is specifically designed for this case and would be expected to have higher power. The robustified test `X^{**}` trades off some efficiency for robustness to heterogeneous integration orders.\n\n**D) The `X^*` test is prone to spurious rejections when component series have different integration orders (`\\delta_i \\neq \\delta_j`) because its single, scalar spectral scaling factor `\\lambda_j^{2d}` is", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

(1))}\n \nwhere `Π(a_j)` is the expected revenue from action `a_j`.\n\nTo test if a mixed strategy is optimal, the paper constructs a feasible contract `C_tilde` that implements `a_2` with some probability `p_tilde < 1`:\n`C_tilde = {(v_1^*, v_2^*), M(x_1)=((v_1^*, v_1^*), (v_1^*, v_2^*)), M(x_2)=G_2}`.\nThis means period 1 payments are `(v_1^*, v_2^*)`. If `x_1` occurs, the agent can choose between a safe contract paying `v_1^*` or a risky one paying `(v_1^*, v_2^*)` in period 2. If `x_2` occurs, she gets a safe payment `G_2`.\n\nThe principal's net gain from using this mixed-strategy contract `C_tilde` over the optimal pure-strategy (`p=1`) contract is:\n  \n\\text{Gain} = B(\\tilde{p};\\tilde{C}) - B(a_2) = -2(1-\\tilde{p})\\gamma K + \\tilde{p}\\gamma [h(v_2^*) - h(G_2)] \\quad \\text{(Eq.

Since `v_2^* = G_1 + (G_2 - G_1)/γ` and `γ < 1`, we have `v_2^* > G_2`. Given that `h` is strictly increasing (as it's the cost of providing utility), `h(v_2^*) > h(G_2)`, making the difference positive, not negative.\n\n**Statement B**: Claims the mixed-strategy contract is preferred when `K` is sufficiently small.\n\nFrom equation (2), the gain is positive when:\n`-2(1-p̃)γK + p̃γ[h(v_2^*) - h(G_2)] > 0`\n\nRearranging: `K < p̃[h(v_2^*) - h(G_2)]/(2(1-p̃))`\n\nSince the right-hand side is positive (as shown above), this inequality holds when `K` is sufficiently small. This statement is correct.\n\n**Statement C**: Claims the optimal renegotiation-proof contract sets period 2 payments equal to period 1 payments.\n\nThis describes a standard feature of optimal renegotiation-proof contracts in this type of model. To prevent renegotiation, the continuation contract after each history must be optimal given the information revealed. Setting period 2 payments equal to the corresponding period 1 payments achieves this. This statement is correct.\n\n**Statement D**: Claims randomization is always optimal for any `K > 0`.\n\nThis is false. From the gain formula, when `K` is large, the negative term `-2(1-p̃)γK` dominates, making the gain negative. The paper explicitly shows that randomization is only optimal for sufficiently small `K`, not for all `K > 0`.", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

The observed distribution of wage changes is not normal; it exhibits distinctive features, including a prominent spike at exactly zero and a visible asymmetry around the mode (fewer observations just below the mode than above it).\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe model assumes that the observed distribution of wage changes is a mixture of three components, all derived from a single underlying, unobserved 'notional' wage change distribution, which is assumed to be normal conditional on worker characteristics.\n1.  **Fully Flexible Regime:** The observed wage change equals the notional wage change.\n2.  **Nominal Rigidity Regime:** The observed wage change is censored from below at zero. If the notional change is negative, the observed change is zero.\n3.  **Real Rigidity Regime:** The observed wage change is censored from below at a positive threshold `r`. If the notional change is less than `r`, the observed change is `r`.\n\nThe key identification challenge is to estimate the population shares of these three unobserved regimes and the parameters of the notional distribution from the shape of the observed distribution.\n\n### Question\n\nAccording to the paper's identification strategy, which of the following statements correctly link features of the observed wage change distribution to the model's components?

Real rigidity creates a censoring point at r > 0, which would cause \"missing mass\" just below the mode (where r likely sits) and create asymmetry as wage changes that would have been below r get pushed up to r.\n\n**Option B**: INCORRECT. The variance helps identify the underlying notional distribution parameters, not the threshold r itself. The location of asymmetry/missing mass would be more informative about r.\n\n**Option C**: INCORRECT. Only nominal rigidity creates a spike at exactly zero (censoring negative changes to 0).

The strategy is to instrument for `$S_{its}$` using a simulated stock, `$Z_{its}$`, constructed from arguably exogenous components.\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe main estimating equation is a linear probability model for welfare participation `$p_{its}$`:\n\n  \np_{i t s}=X_{i t}{\\Lambda}+V_{t s}\\Phi+L\\left({\\frac{S_{i t s}}{H_{i t}}}\\right)\\pi+\\mu_{s}+\\psi_{s}f(t)+\\nu_{y}+\\varepsilon_{i t s} \\quad \\text{(Eq. (1))}\n \n\nTo address the endogeneity of `$L(S_{its}/H_{it})$`, the strategy uses instruments based on simulated remaining benefits, `$Z_{its}$`, defined as:\n\n  \nZ_{i t s}=N_{s}-k_{j}*E_{i t s} \\quad \\text{(Eq. (2))}\n \n\nwhere `$N_s$` is the state-specific initial benefit endowment, `$E_{its}$` is the individual-specific exposure to time limits, and `$k_j$` is the pre-reform average welfare use for sociodemographic group `j`.\n\n---\n\nAccording to the paper's methodology, which of the following are valid statements regarding the endogeneity problem and the instrumental variable (IV) strategy? Select all that apply.", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "Looking at this instrumental variable (IV) strategy, I need to evaluate each statement about the endogeneity problem and the proposed solution.\n\n**Statement A**: This correctly describes the exclusion restriction requirement for IV validity. The instrument (based on $Z_{its}$) must affect current welfare participation $p_{its}$ only through its impact on actual remaining benefits $S_{its}$, with no direct effect. This is a fundamental requirement for any IV strategy.\n\n**Statement B**: This accurately describes how the instrument achieves exogeneity. The key insight is that $Z_{its}$ replaces the individual's actual (endogenous) welfare history with a group-level prediction based on pre-reform averages ($k_j$) for their sociodemographic group. This breaks the correlation with individual-specific unobservables.\n\n**Statement C**: This is incorrect. IV validity requires the instrument to be correlated with the endogenous variable (relevance condition), not that it be more strongly correlated with the outcome than the endogenous variable is. In fact, instruments typically have weaker correlations with the outcome than the endogenous variable they're replacing.\n\n**Statement D**: This correctly identifies the source of endogeneity. Unobserved persistent characteristics (like poor health) create a correlation between the error term and $S_{its}$ because they affect both past welfare use (which determines current remaining benefits) and current welfare use. This violates the exogeneity assumption needed for unbiased OLS estimation.\n\nA,B,D", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

When damage functions are strictly convex, the marginal damage increases with pollution levels. If we treat each polluter as the \"last-in\" (calculating their marginal contribution at the full pollution level), the sum of these marginal contributions exceeds the total damage due to the convexity property. This creates genuine ambiguity in assigning responsibility.\n\n**Statement B**: This correctly explains the rationale for the Single-Polluter Upper Bound (SPUB). With convex damages, there's a negative externality where one polluter's presence increases the marginal damage cost for others, forcing them to reduce emissions below their individual optima.

The IV addresses endogeneity from all sources (including ability bias), and the similar estimates could result from: (1) minimal ability bias, (2) offsetting biases, or (3) the LATE applying to a different population than the OLS estimate.

For pollution/labor: coefficient = 0.120 (t-stat = 0.449)\n\nLet me evaluate each option:\n\n**Option A**: Both coefficients are negative and statistically significant (|t-stat| > 2). The pollution intensity elasticity is -0.875 and the labor intensity elasticity is -1.003. Both are reasonably close to -1, and given their standard errors, they would likely be statistically indistinguishable from -1. ✓\n\n**Option B**: Since ln(P/L) = ln(P/Q) - ln(L/Q), the coefficient on ln(y) in the P/L regression equals φ_y - γ_y. With a t-stat of 0.449 (not significant), this tests whether φ_y - γ_y = 0, which is equivalent to testing φ_y = γ_y. ✓\n\n**Option C**: With elasticities close to -1, a doubling of income (100% increase) would lead to approximately a halving of both intensities (50% decrease). This follows from the log-log specification. ✓\n\n**Option D**: The coefficient for pollution/labor is 0.120 with t-stat = 0.449, which is not statistically significant (|t-stat| < 2).

It contrasts Starrett's model of market failure, based on an implicit assumption of unbounded pollution rights, with the paper's alternative Coasian model where bounded, tradable property rights restore market equilibrium.\n\n**Setting / Institutional Environment.** The analysis begins with Starrett's classic example of a steel mill (polluter) and a laundry (victim). The focus is on the Arrow market for the \"laundry's observation of steel production,\" which functions as a market for pollution rights. This is then contrasted with the paper's two-industry model where the total stock of externality rights is explicitly bounded.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\n**Part 1: Starrett's Arrow Market**\n- Let `p_e` be the price of the Arrow commodity (the right to pollute).\n- **Supply of rights by the laundry, `S(p_e)`:** The laundry is endowed with the right to a clean environment.\n  - If `p_e > 0`, the laundry can earn infinite revenue by shutting down and selling an infinite number of rights. Thus, `S(p_e) = ∞`.\n  - If `p_e = 0`, the laundry supplies zero rights. Thus, `S(p_e) = 0`.\n- **Demand for rights by the steel mill, `D(p_e)`:** The mill demands a finite, positive number of rights, `D(p_e) > 0`.\n\n**Part 2: The Paper's Coasian Model with Bounded Rights**\n- Two industries: laundry (`l`) and steel (`s`). Inputs are labor (`x_l`, `x_s`) and externality rights (`e_l`, `e_s`).\n- Total rights are fixed: `η_l + η_s = 100`, where `η_i` is the initial endowment for firm `i`.\n- **Production & Externality:**\n  \n\\ell = x_{\\ell} + e_{\\ell} \\quad \\text{(Eq. (1))}\n \n  \ns = x_{s} \\quad \\text{(Eq. (2))}\n \n  \ne_{s} = 0.5s \\quad \\text{(Eq.

Option A is incorrect.\n\n**Option B**: The paper's argument is precisely the opposite - it's not the externality itself that causes market failure, but rather Starrett's implicit assumption of unbounded pollution rights. The paper shows that with bounded, tradable rights, equilibrium can be restored even with externalities. Option B is incorrect.\n\n**Option C**: This correctly describes the market failure in Starrett's model. At p_e > 0, the laundry can shut down and sell infinite rights (S(p_e) = ∞). At p_e = 0, it supplies zero rights (S(p_e) = 0). Neither case can match the steel mill's finite positive demand D(p_e) > 0, so no equilibrium exists. Option C is correct.\n\n**Option D**: From the calculation in Option A, we showed that π_s = η_s. This means the steel mill's profit equals its initial endowment of rights, regardless of its production level s. This demonstrates how the Coasian model resolves the market failure - firms' profits depend only on their initial endowments, not production decisions.

The user cost of R&D is `U = (r+δ)(1-ρ)`. The policy effectively increases the marginal credit rate `ρ` for some firms. For firms with positive tax liability, the effective `ρ` increases by 0.15 (from 0.20 to 0.35). For firms with zero tax liability, the effective `ρ` increases by 0.35 (from 0.00 to 0.35).

It tests understanding of the relationship between reduced-form and structural parameters.\nDepth Strategy: Computational Judgment. The user must calculate intermediate values (the denominator and numerator of the elasticity formula) and the final elasticity for two different scenarios, then evaluate statements based on these calculations.\nDistractor Logic:\n- A (Correct): Requires calculating the denominator of Eq. (1) for Scenario 1: `(0.20 * 0.43 - 0.35) / 0.65 = (0.086 - 0.35) / 0.65 = -0.264 / 0.65 ≈ -0.406`. The paper states this is `dln(U)`, but the formula in the paper is `dln(E[U]) = [0.20*p - 0.35]`. The change in user cost is `(0.20*0.43 - 0.35) = -0.264`. The percentage change is `dln(U) = -dρ/(1-ρ) = -0.264/0.65 = -0.406`. The question asks for the average percentage change in user cost, which is `(0.20p - 0.35) = (0.20*0.43 - 0.35) = -0.264`, or -26.4%. Let me re-read the paper. The paper states `dln(U)/dT = -0.35/0.65` for zero-tax and `-0.15/0.65` for tax-paying. The average is `p*(-0.15/0.65) + (1-p)*(-0.35/0.65) = (p*(-0.15) + (1-p)*(-0.35))/0.65 = (-0.15p - 0.35 + 0.35p)/0.65 = (0.20p - 0.35)/0.65`. For Scenario 1: `(0.20*0.43 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.406`. This is `dln(U)`. The question asks for the average percentage change. This is `dln(U)`. Let me re-check the paper's formula. `dln(E[U]) = [0.20*p - 0.35]`. This seems to be a typo in the paper's formula, it should be divided by 0.65. Let's assume the formula in the paper `(0.20p-0.35)` is the key part. Let's re-evaluate. The denominator of the elasticity is `dln(U)`. The paper's formula is `(0.65 * β1/s) / (0.20p - 0.35)`. This implies `dln(U)` is `(0.20p - 0.35) / 0.65`. For S1: `(0.20*0.43 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.406`. For S2: `(0.20*0.65 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.338`. The elasticity for S1 is `(0.17/0.59) / -0.406 = -0.71`. The elasticity for S2 is `(0.17/0.11) / -0.338 = -4.57`. Okay, calculations match the paper. Now let's check the options. A: `dln(U)` for S1 is `-0.406`. This is a -40.6% change. The option says -24.3%. This is incorrect. Let me re-read the prompt. Ah, the prompt's formula is `ε = (0.65 * β1/s) / (0.20p - 0.35)`. This is the formula from the paper. Let's re-check the paper's text. `dln(U)/dT = -0.35/0.65` for zero-tax, and `-0.15/0.65` for tax-paying. The average `dln(U)` is `p*(-0.15/0.65) + (1-p)*(-0.35/0.65) = (0.20p - 0.35)/0.65`. The paper's equation (4) has a typo, it omits the division by 0.65 in the denominator. I will use the correct derivation from the text. So `dln(U) = (0.20p - 0.35)/0.65`. For S1, `dln(U) = (0.20*0.43 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.406`. For S2, `dln(U) = (0.20*0.65 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.338`. Now let's re-evaluate the options. A: `dln(U)` for S1 is -40.6%. Option A is incorrect. B: Elasticity for S2 is `(β1/s) / dln(U) = (0.17/0.11) / -0.338 = 1.545 / -0.338 = -4.57`. Option B is correct. C: TOT for S1 is `0.17/0.59 = 0.288`. TOT for S2 is `0.17/0.11 = 1.545`. So TOT is larger in S2. Option C is incorrect. D: Magnitude of `dln(U)` is `|-0.406|` for S1 and `|-0.338|` for S2. The magnitude of the cost change is *larger* in S1. The statement says it's *smaller* in S2, which is true. But it says this explains why the elasticity is larger in S2. This is wrong. The elasticity is larger in S2 because the TOT (`β1/s`) is much, much larger, overwhelming the smaller change in user cost. So D is incorrect. I only have one correct answer (B). This violates the core rule. I must use the Single-Correct-Answer Inversion Protocol. The question becomes 'Which of the following statements... are INCORRECT?'. The new correct answers are A, C, D. Let's re-craft the options to make it a better question. Let's try to make two options correct without inversion. Let's re-read the paper's table. The elasticity for S1 is -0.71. My calculation: `(0.17/0.59) / ((0.20*0.43-0.35)/0.65) = 0.288 / -0.406 = -0.709`. Correct. The elasticity for S2 is -4.57. My calculation: `(0.17/0.11) / ((0.20*0.65-0.35)/0.65) = 1.545 / -0.338 = -4.56`. Correct. Let's re-check my option analysis. A: `dln(U)` for S1 is -40.6%. Option A says -24.3%. Incorrect. B: Elasticity for S2 is -4.57. Correct. C: TOT for S1 is 0.29. TOT for S2 is 1.55. So TOT is larger in S2. Option C says it's larger in S1. Incorrect. D: Magnitude of `dln(U)` is larger in S1 (0.406) than S2 (0.338). Option D says the opposite. Incorrect. Still only one correct answer. Let me try to create new options. Let's make A correct. Let's calculate `dln(U)` for a different variable. Let's stick to the prompt. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-read the paper's formula (4). It is `(0.65 * β1/s) / [0.20p - 0.35]`. This is what I put in the prompt. Let's calculate with this formula. S1: `(0.65 * 0.17/0.59) / (0.20*0.43 - 0.35) = 0.187 / -0.264 = -0.71`. S2: `(0.65 * 0.17/0.11) / (0.20*0.65 - 0.35) = 1.0045 / -0.22 = -4.56`. The final elasticities are the same. The intermediate components are different. Let's re-evaluate the options based on the components of *this* formula. A: The denominator is `0.20p - 0.35`. For S1, this is `0.20*0.43 - 0.35 = -0.264`. This is the average change in the credit rate `ρ`. The question asks for the percentage change in user cost `U`. This is still `dln(U)`. The formula in the prompt is just a rearrangement. The logic holds. I have one correct answer. I will apply the inversion protocol. New stem: '...which of the following statements... are INCORRECT?'. New answer: `['A', 'C', 'D']`. This is compliant. But let me try one more time to build a compliant affirmative question. What if I change option A? Let's calculate the numerator of the formula for S1: `0.65 * 0.17 / 0.59 = 0.187`. Let's make an option about that. What about the denominator? For S2: `0.20*0.65 - 0.35 = -0.22`. Let's make an option about that. Let's try this: A: 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 1 is approximately -0.71.' (Correct). B: 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 2 is approximately -4.57.' (Correct). C: 'The Treatment-on-the-Treated effect (`β_1 / s`) is smaller in Scenario 1 than in Scenario 2.' (Correct: 0.29 vs 1.55). D: 'The denominator term `(0.20p - 0.35)` is larger (less negative) in Scenario 2 than in Scenario 1.' (Correct: -0.22 vs -0.264). Now I have four correct answers. This is also not ideal. Let's go back to the original set and invert. It's the cleanest path. A is incorrect because the calculation is wrong. B is correct. C is incorrect because it reverses the comparison. D is incorrect because it misstates the reason for the larger elasticity. This is a good set of distractors. The inversion protocol is the right tool here. Okay, I will use the inversion protocol. I will re-write the question stem to be negative and the answer key to be `['A', 'C', 'D']`. Wait, I can just fix option A. Let's make it correct. `dln(U)` for S1 is -40.6%. Let's make option A: 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 1 is approximately -0.71.' This is correct, as calculated. Now A and B are correct. Let's check C and D again. C: TOT is larger in S2. Statement says larger in S1. Incorrect. D: `dln(U)` magnitude is larger in S1. Statement says elasticity is larger in S2 because `dln(U)` magnitude is smaller in S2. This is true (`|-0.338| < |-0.406|`). But is it the *reason*? The TOT effect (`β1/s`) increases from 0.29 to 1.55 (a 5x increase), while the `dln(U)` magnitude only decreases from 0.406 to 0.338 (a ~17% decrease). The change in the numerator is the dominant factor. So the reasoning in D is flawed. It's a 'True but Irrelevant/Misleading' distractor. So A and B are correct. C and D are incorrect. This works. I will use this version. It avoids the inversion protocol and is a strong question. I will re-write the justification. Okay, final check. A: `(0.65 * 0.17/0.59) / (0.20*0.43 - 0.35) = -0.71`. Correct. B: `(0.65 * 0.17/0.11) / (0.20*0.65 - 0.35) = -4.57`. Correct. C: `0.17/0.59 = 0.288`. `0.17/0.11 = 1.545`. `0.288 < 1.545`. Statement says S1 > S2. Incorrect. D: `|0.20*0.65 - 0.35| = 0.22`. `|0.20*0.43 - 0.35| = 0.264`. `0.22 < 0.264`. So magnitude of denominator is smaller in S2. This part is true. But the reason the elasticity is so much larger is the massive increase in the numerator (`β1/s`). So the reasoning is incomplete and misleading. It's a good distractor. Final answer is `['A', 'B']`. This is compliant. I will proceed with this. I will re-write the original option A to be correct. The original option A was about `dln(U)`. I will change it to be about the final elasticity. This is better. My new option A is 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 1 is approximately -0.71.' This is correct. My new option B is 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 2 is approximately -4.57.' This is correct. My new option C is 'The Treatment-on-the-Treated (TOT) effect, represented by `β_1 / s`, is larger in Scenario 1 than in Scenario 2.' This is incorrect. My new option D is 'The magnitude of the calculated elasticity is larger in Scenario 2 primarily because the average change in user cost for treated firms is smaller in magnitude than in Scenario 1.' This is incorrect because the numerator is the primary driver. So the answer is `['A', 'B']`. This is a solid question. I will use this. Wait, the original prompt had option A as 'In Scenario 1, the average percentage change in the user cost of R&D for treated firms is approximately -24.3%.' Let me re-calculate `dln(U) = (0.20p - 0.35)/0.65`. For S1: `(0.20*0.43 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.406`. So -40.6%. The option is wrong. I will stick with my plan to make A and B the correct final elasticities. It's cleaner. Okay, let's re-write the options from scratch to be perfect. A: Elasticity S1 is -0.71. (Correct). B: Elasticity S2 is -4.57. (Correct). C: The TOT `β1/s` is larger in S2 than S1. (Correct). D: The magnitude of the average % change in user cost `|dln(U)|` is larger in S1 than S2. (Correct: `|-0.406| > |-0.338|`). This gives 4 correct answers. Not good. Let's go back to the original set and use the inversion protocol. It was the right call. The distractors are well-designed. One correct calculation, one incorrect calculation, one reversed comparison, one flawed reasoning. It's a strong set. The single correct answer is B. So I will invert. Stem becomes '...are INCORRECT?'. Answer becomes `['A', 'C', 'D']`. This is the way.

A lump-sum transfer creates deadweight loss by providing payments to families who would have made the efficient choice anyway (inframarginal families). This is a standard result in public economics - universal transfers are less efficient than targeted interventions when the goal is to change behavior at the margin.\n\n**Option B**: \"Subsidizing informal care would likely be less expensive than subsidizing formal care because family members have lower opportunity costs than professional caregivers.\"\n- This is incorrect. The statement makes an unfounded generalization. Many family caregivers are working-age adults who may have high wages/opportunity costs. The paper's empirical findings explicitly show that the opportunity cost of informal care is \"large.\" There's no reason to assume family members systematically have lower opportunity costs than professional caregivers.\n\n**Option C**: \"A key implementation challenge for subsidizing informal care is the difficulty in verifying the actual hours and quality of non-market care provided.\"\n- This is correct. Informal care occurs within households without market transactions, making it very difficult to monitor and verify. This is a classic challenge in designing policies for non-market activities - there's significant potential for moral hazard and fraud when subsidizing activities that cannot be easily observed or measured.\n\n**Option D**: \"A lump-sum transfer is considered a 'neutral' policy because it does not alter the relative private costs of formal versus informal care.\"\n- This is correct. A lump-sum transfer provides the same amount regardless of the care choice made. It doesn't change the relative prices faced by families (formal care still costs P_F(1-s) while informal care costs w_i in opportunity cost). This neutrality preserves the family's incentive to choose based on actual costs, though it may still result in inefficient choices if there are pre-existing distortions.\n\nA,C,D", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

At the first-best effort level n_l^{FB}, where θ^l g'(n_l^{FB}) = c, we have a first-order condition.

The regressors `$x_d$` are orthogonal, leading to very precise, low-variance estimates of `$\\beta$`.\n*   **Scenario B:** An ARCH model is used to predict the variance of a financial return `$y_f$`.

The ARCH model's non-linearity also suggests substantial curvature in the log-density. In Scenario A, $V(\\hat{\\theta}_d)$ is very small due to precise estimates from orthogonal regressors.

The optimal scheme `(r*, ν*)` has `r*(w) = w`, meaning no income is concealed and no resources are lost to the `g(·)` function.\n- B (Correct): The average tax rate is `(w - ν*(w)) / w = (w - g(w) - C) / w`.

This formula depends only on the tax avoidance technology g(·) and the income distribution F, not on the utility function u(·).\n\nB) The optimal tax scheme is designed such that, in equilibrium, no resources are wasted on the tax avoidance technology.\n\nThis is TRUE. The optimal scheme induces full reporting (r*(w) = w), meaning no income is concealed.

In such models, the effect of a change in a covariate on the outcome probability is not a single parameter but varies with each observation's position in the spatial network.\n\n**Setting / Institutional Environment.** The Average Structural Function (ASF) provides a method to summarize these heterogeneous effects into a single, interpretable measure, the Average Partial Effect (APE). This allows for policy analysis and a general understanding of the model's implications.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe model is a latent variable framework where the binary outcome is generated by `Y_i = 1[X_iβ + ε_i > 0]`. The unobserved error term is assumed to be conditionally normal with a non-constant variance that depends on the spatial structure:\n  \n\\varepsilon_{i} | X, W \\sim \\text{Normal}(0, h_{i}(W, \\lambda)) \\quad \\text{(Eq. (1))}\n \nThis leads to the following conditional response probability, a heteroskedastic probit model:\n  \nP(Y_{i}=1|X,W) = \\Phi\\left[ \\frac{X_{i}\\beta}{\\sqrt{h_{i}(W,\\lambda)}} \\right] \\quad \\text{(Eq. (2))}\n \nwhere `Φ(·)` is the standard normal CDF. The partial effect of a continuous covariate `X_ik` on this probability is:\n  \n\\frac{\\partial P(Y_i=1|X_i,W)}{\\partial X_{ik}} = \\phi\\left( \\frac{X_i\\beta}{\\sqrt{h_i(W, \\lambda)}} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\beta_k}{\\sqrt{h_i(W, \\lambda)}}\n \nwhere `φ(·)` is the standard normal PDF. The Average Partial Effect (APE) is the sample average of these individual partial effects.\n\n### Question\n\nConsider a policy change that strengthens spatial linkages, described by a new weights matrix `W*`. This policy does not alter the behavioral parameters `β` or `λ`, but it uniformly increases the error variance for all locations, such that `h_i(W*, λ) > h_i(W, λ)` for all `i`. Assume the relevant coefficient `β_k` is positive. Select all correct statements describing the consequences of this policy.\n", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "Looking at this problem, I need to analyze how an increase in error variance affects partial effects in a heteroskedastic probit model.\n\nGiven information:\n- The partial effect is: $\\frac{\\partial P(Y_i=1|X_i,W)}{\\partial X_{ik}} = \\phi\\left( \\frac{X_i\\beta}{\\sqrt{h_i(W, \\lambda)}} \\right) \\cdot \\frac{\\beta_k}{\\sqrt{h_i(W, \\lambda)}}$\n- The policy change increases $h_i$ for all observations\n- $\\beta_k > 0$\n\nLet me analyze each option:\n\n**Option A**: When $h_i$ increases, the term $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{h_i}}$ decreases, which directly reduces the magnitude of the partial effect through the multiplicative term. Additionally, increased error variance makes the outcome less predictable from the covariates. This statement is correct.\n\n**Option B**: The standard probit assumes homoskedasticity ($h_i = 1$). When the true model has heteroskedasticity that increases further from 1, the bias in the standard probit estimator would increase, not decrease. Moreover, its estimated average partial effects would become less accurate, not more. This statement is incorrect.\n\n**Option C**: While it's true that $\\frac{X_i\\beta}{\\sqrt{h_i}}$ moves closer to zero (where $\\phi$ is maximized) when $h_i$ increases, this ignores the direct multiplicative effect of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{h_i}}$. The overall effect depends on the balance between these two forces, and the statement claims an \"unambiguous increase\" which is not guaranteed. This statement is incorrect.\n\n**Option D**: The partial effect has a direct multiplicative term $\\frac{\\beta_k}{\\sqrt{h_i}}$.

In this model, when a searcher rejects an object, it returns to the pool and can be encountered again by others. This doesn't improve pool quality - it actually maintains or worsens it by keeping low-quality objects in circulation.\n\n**Option B**: Claims the equilibrium is efficient with `\\underline{x}^e = \\underline{x}^w`.\n- This is incorrect. Search models typically feature externalities that create a wedge between private and social optimality. Individual searchers don't internalize the full social impact of their search decisions.\n\n**Option C**: Claims the social optimum is `\\underline{x}^w = 0` because `W(\\underline{x})` is strictly decreasing.\n- Looking at equation (1), `W(\\underline{x})` represents the expected payoff from accepting objects above threshold `\\underline{x}`. As `\\underline{x}` increases, fewer objects are accepted (the first term decreases) while the expected quality of accepted objects increases (the second term).

Individual searchers don't internalize this cost.\n- However, it assumes `\\underline{x}^w = 0`, which as discussed in Option C, is not necessarily true without more information about the distribution.\n- Since it relies on the incorrect assumption that `\\underline{x}^w = 0`, this statement is also incorrect.\n\nA,B,C,D", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

A finite truncation of the game would have a unique cyclical SPE, as the end-period `T` would fix the phase of the cycle.", "qid": "378", "question": "### Background\n\nThis problem analyzes the credibility of pure strategy equilibria in a game of trade liberalization. The government prefers to liberalize but is willing to wait if it can induce the firm to invest. The firm prefers protection but will invest if it believes liberalization is imminent.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe government's payoff from a successful `q`-period protection is `X_1(q)`, and its payoff from immediate liberalization is `Y_1(0)`. A key parameter, `q*`, is the maximum number of periods the government is willing to wait, defined by:\n  \nX_1(q^*) > Y_1(0) > X_1(q^*+1)\n \n**Eq.

The government's threat to liberalize in period 2 is credible because of the strategic structure of the game, not because payoffs change. The government's payoffs X₁(q) and Y₁(0) are fixed parameters that don't change based on the firm's actions.\n\n**Statement B**: This is correct. The equilibrium strategies g^k(t) and f^k(t) depend only on the current period t through modular arithmetic (t ≡ k+1 (mod q*+1) and t ≡ k (mod q*+1)). They don't depend on the history of past actions. The multiplicity comes from the k different ways to index these cycles, not from history-dependent strategies.\n\n**Statement C**: This is incorrect. The existence of q*+1 distinct SPEs comes from the cyclical nature of the strategies with period q*+1, not from any finite truncation. These equilibria would exist even in an infinite horizon game.\n\n**Statement D**: This is correct. When the firm deviates from the SPE supporting one-period protection, the prescribed punishment is immediate liberalization. However, both players would prefer to coordinate on a different equilibrium that gives them higher payoffs than immediate liberalization. This makes the original equilibrium not renegotiation-proof, as the players have an incentive to renegotiate away from the punishment.\n\nB,D", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

Agent 1 has standard preferences and consumption set R_+^∞.

Lenders observe a rich set of financial data for each borrower, in addition to optional, unverified information like pictures. A key institutional feature is that borrowers whose listings expire without funding are able to relist their requests, often with modified terms (e.g., a higher maximum interest rate). The platform also allows borrowers to join 'groups' organized around a theme (e.g., university alumni), which provides social pressure to repay.\n\n**Variables & Parameters.**\n- `Funded_i`: An indicator variable equal to 1 if listing `i` was funded, 0 otherwise.\n- `X_i`: A vector of characteristics for listing `i` coded from pictures (e.g., an indicator for the borrower being perceived as black) and the one-line text description.\n- `Z_i`: A vector of other observable characteristics of the listing and borrower, including a comprehensive set of credit controls (credit grade, debt-to-income ratio, delinquencies, etc.) and loan parameters.\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe researchers' basic empirical strategy involves estimating the probability that a loan listing gets funded as a function of the listing characteristics observed by lenders.

Statistical discrimination is based on using observable characteristics (like race) as proxies for unobservable characteristics (like creditworthiness). It doesn't require a \"known history of relisting\" - lenders can statistically discriminate even on first-time listings. The distinction between taste-based and statistical discrimination isn't about relisting history.\n\nB) This is a valid reason. If borrowers who fail to get funded can relist with different terms (like higher interest rates), this creates a selection issue where the sample includes both initial attempts and strategic relistings, which could confound the results.\n\nC) This statement is incorrect. There's no reason why the Black indicator would be \"mechanically correlated\" with the number of relistings. Being Black doesn't automatically determine how many times someone relists. Even if there were some correlation, this wouldn't create perfect multicollinearity (which requires perfect linear dependence).\n\nD) This is a valid reason. By looking only at first-time listings, the analysis compares all borrowers at the same starting point, before any selection has occurred through funding failures and decisions about whether to relist.\n\nTherefore, statements A and C are NOT valid reasons or INCORRECTLY describe the implications.\n\nA,C", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

The goal is to derive the formulas for extracting implied forward rates from each type of long rate and to understand the practical consequences of their differences.\n\n**Setting / Institutional Environment.** We assume a bond market with certain expectations about future one-period interest rates (`r_j`). The price of any bond is the present value of its cash flows, discounted by this sequence of forward rates.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe `n`-period Hicksian long rate, `R'_n`, is the yield on an `n`-period zero-coupon bond, defined by:\n  \n(1+R'_{n})^{n} = (1+r_{1})(1+r_{2})\\ldots(1+r_{n}) \\quad \\text{(Eq.

The Lutzian rate is defined for coupon bonds selling at par, and extracting forward rates from it requires accounting for the coupon payments, which is what the term `b_{n-1}` represents. The formula `(1+R''_n) / (b_{n-1}(R''_n - R''_{n-1}) + 1)` is consistent with the recursive nature of Lutzian rates.\n\n**Statement B**: This is correct. The Hicksian forward rate can be calculated directly from consecutive Hicksian long rates using the formula in Statement D. However, the Lutzian forward rate calculation requires knowledge of the term `b_{n-1}`, which depends on all previous rates, making it path-dependent.\n\n**Statement C**: This is incorrect. The Hicksian long rate is based on geometric compounding, not arithmetic averaging. From equation (1): `(1+R'_2)^2 = (1+r_1)(1+r_2)`, which means `R'_2` is the geometric mean minus 1, not the arithmetic average.\n\n**Statement D**: This is correct.

There's no indication in the text that P_T maintains its properties when this condition is violated. ✗\n\n**Option D**: Since the power envelope is derived under Condition C (bounded second moment), it doesn't constrain what's achievable against alternatives that violate this assumption. A test designed to exploit the unbounded variance of u₀ under strict stationarity could potentially exceed the envelope, which wasn't designed to bound power against such alternatives. ✓\n\nA,B,D", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}

All GMM estimators, including System GMM, fundamentally rely on the assumption that instruments are uncorrelated with the error term (orthogonality conditions). This is a core requirement for consistency.\n\n**Option B**: \"System GMM is more efficient than the First-Difference GMM estimator when explanatory variables like inequality are highly persistent over time, as it uses additional moment conditions from the level equation\"\n- This is TRUE. System GMM combines moment conditions from both the first-differenced equation and the level equation. When variables are highly persistent (close to unit root), first-differencing creates weak instruments. The additional level equation moments in System GMM help address this problem, improving efficiency.\n\n**Option C**: \"System GMM is the only estimator that can accommodate both a positive short-term (δ₁) and a negative lagged (δ₂) effect of a variable\"\n- This is FALSE. The ability to estimate coefficients with different signs is not unique to System GMM. Any linear estimator (OLS, FE, RE, etc.) can estimate models where variables have different signed effects. This is about model specification, not estimator choice.\n\n**Option D**: \"System GMM is designed to handle the endogeneity introduced by the lagged dependent variable (y_{t-1}) in a dynamic panel model\"\n- This is TRUE. This is precisely why GMM methods were developed for dynamic panels. In short panels, the presence of y_{t-1} creates correlation with the error term (especially in fixed effects transformations), leading to inconsistent estimates with standard methods. System GMM addresses this by using appropriate lagged values as instruments.\n\nB,D", "model_answer": ["A", "B", "C", "D"], "error": null}}
