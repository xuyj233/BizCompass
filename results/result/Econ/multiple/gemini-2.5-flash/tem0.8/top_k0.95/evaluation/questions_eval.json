    "Question": "### Background\n\nA social planner designs a 'regulatory charter' to govern a long-term investment project undertaken by a profit-maximizing firm. The project spans two periods. Decision-making is delegated to two different short-lived, 'myopic' regulators: R1 in period 1 and R2 in period 2. Each regulator seeks to maximize the welfare of consumers only during their own tenure. The firm is long-lived and maximizes the discounted sum of its profits.\n\nThe core friction arises because key state variables—a technology parameter `θ` that affects benefits in both periods, and an idiosyncratic first-period shock `ε`—are observable to the regulators and the firm, but are not verifiable by a third party (e.g., a court). Therefore, payments in the charter can only be conditioned on observable actions: whether investment occurs and whether it is later adopted.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\n**Period 1: Investment Decision**\nAn investment of fixed cost `I` can be made. First-period consumer benefits from investment are `b₁(θ, ε) = αθ + δε`, where `α, δ > 0`. The status quo benefit without investment is `b₀`. It is assumed that `b₁(θ, ε) < I` for all `(θ, ε)`, meaning first-period benefits alone never justify the investment cost.\n\n1.  **Regulator R1's Rule:** R1, caring only about period 1 consumers, authorizes investment if and only if their net welfare is non-negative compared to the status quo. Let `P₁¹` and `P₁⁰` be the payments from period 1 consumers to the firm with and without investment, respectively. R1's rule is:\n      \nb₁(\\theta, \\varepsilon) - P₁¹ \\ge b₀ - P₁⁰ \\quad \\text{(Eq. (1))}\n     \n\n2.  **The Firm's Rule:** The firm's decision depends on expected discounted profits. A higher `θ` signals a higher probability of large second-period consumer benefits, `b₂`, drawn from a distribution `F(b₂|θ)` where `∂F/∂θ < 0`. If the project is adopted in period 2, the firm receives a private, non-transferable benefit `π₂(θ)`, where `π₂'(θ) > 0`. The firm's decision to invest is independent of `ε`.\n\n3.  **The Optimal Charter:** The paper's Proposition 1 characterizes the optimal (second-best) regulatory charter. A key property of the payments set by the planner is the 'no expropriation' condition, which ensures the firm breaks even if the project is undertaken but ultimately abandoned:\n      \nP_{1}^{1} - I + \\beta P_{2}^{10} = 0 \\quad \\text{(Eq. (2))}\n     \n    `P₂¹⁰` is the payment upon abandonment and `β` is the discount factor.\n\n### Question\n\nBased on the model and the properties of the optimal regulatory charter, select all statements that are TRUE.",
    "Options": {
      "A": "The firm's expected profit from investing is strictly increasing in `θ` because a higher `θ` both increases the firm's private payoff upon adoption (`π₂(θ)`) and increases the probability of adoption.",
      "B": "Regulator R1 becomes more willing to approve the investment as `θ` increases, meaning R1's approval threshold `εᴿ(θ)` is a downward-sloping line in `(θ, ε)`-space.",
      "C": "The 'no expropriation' condition (Eq. (2)) ensures the firm earns zero expected profit from investing for all `θ` values where investment occurs.",

Since the denominator is positive, this simplifies to `p_{mm}φ_y - p_{md} ≥ 0`, which rearranges to the stated upper bound.\n- C (Distractor - Conceptual Opposite): The restriction in B allows for `p_{md} > 0`, meaning some contamination from the expansionary demand shock can remain.

A vote for B, while unable to win the current election, provides information to other type-1 voters about B's underlying support, which is valuable for coordinating in the period 2 election.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe paper's model of communicative voting in a three-candidate race (Proposition 6) shows that it can be rational for voters to support a third candidate (e.g., B) even if that candidate has no chance of winning the current election. This occurs because the vote serves a communicative purpose for future elections. However, this can lead to an inefficient outcome in period 1 if candidate C (the least preferred candidate of the majority) wins because the majority splits its vote between A and B.\n\n### Question\n\nConsider the implications of this model for electoral system design. Which of the following statements accurately describe the model's findings or logical extensions regarding the efficiency of different voting systems?\n",

Given the formal first-order condition, the user must deduce the economic implications for efficiency and quality distortion.\nDistractor Logic:\n- A (Correct): This is a direct interpretation of the FOC. If `λ ≠ 0` and `v_{Qt} > 0`, then for the equation to hold, it must be that `v_Q - c_Q ≠ 0`, which is the definition of inefficiency. `λ ≠ 0` signifies a binding IC constraint.\n- B (Incorrect - Conceptual Distractor): The tension is not with the participation constraint (which is endogenous due to competition) but with the *incentive compatibility* constraint. A high-type buyer is tempted to mimic a low-type, and the supplier distorts the low-type's contract to prevent this.\n- C (Correct): If `λ > 0`, the FOC can be rearranged to `v_Q - c_Q = -λ*v_{Qt} / (Pr*h)`. Since the right side is negative, `v_Q < c_Q`. Assuming concavity of the surplus function, this implies that quality is under-provided.\n- D (Correct): The paper states the standard transversality conditions `λ(t_min,θ) = λ(t_max,θ) = 0`.

The agent's period 1 action (`a_1` for shirk, `a_2` for diligent) becomes her private information ('type') in the period 2 renegotiation subgame.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe technology linking actions to outputs (`x_1 < x_2`) in each period is:\n\n| Action | Prob(x_1) | Prob(x_2) |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| `a_1` | 1 | 0 |\n| `a_2` | 1-`γ` | `γ` |\n\nLet `h(v)` be the principal's cost of providing `v` units of utility to the agent; `h` is strictly convex. Let `G_j` be the per-period utility cost of action `a_j`, with `G_1 < G_2`. The optimal one-period contract to induce `a_2` consists of utility payments `v_1^* = G_1` and `v_2^* = G_1 + (G_2 - G_1)/γ`.\n\nThe principal's utility from implementing `a_2` with certainty (`p=1`) via an optimal renegotiation-proof contract is `B(a_2)`. The net productivity gain from action `a_2` is parameterized by `K > 0` such that:\n  \n\\Pi(a_2) - \\Pi(a_1) = \\gamma[h(v_2^*) - h(v_1^*)] + K \\quad \\text{(Eq. (1))}\n \nwhere `Π(a_j)` is the expected revenue from action `a_j`.\n\nTo test if a mixed strategy is optimal, the paper constructs a feasible contract `C_tilde` that implements `a_2` with some probability `p_tilde < 1`:\n`C_tilde = {(v_1^*, v_2^*), M(x_1)=((v_1^*, v_1^*), (v_1^*, v_2^*)), M(x_2)=G_2}`.\nThis means period 1 payments are `(v_1^*, v_2^*)`. If `x_1` occurs, the agent can choose between a safe contract paying `v_1^*` or a risky one paying `(v_1^*, v_2^*)` in period 2. If `x_2` occurs, she gets a safe payment `G_2`.\n\nThe principal's net gain from using this mixed-strategy contract `C_tilde` over the optimal pure-strategy (`p=1`) contract is:\n  \n\\text{Gain} = B(\\tilde{p};\\tilde{C}) - B(a_2) = -2(1-\\tilde{p})\\gamma K + \\tilde{p}\\gamma [h(v_2^*) - h(G_2)] \\quad \\text{(Eq. (2))}\n \n\n### Question\n\nBased on the model and the provided contracts, select all statements that are correct.",

Type `h` has a higher marginal rate of substitution (`MRS_{b,a}`) for benefits `b` versus a lump-sum payment `a` than type `l`.

The user must apply the principles of revenue equivalence and constrained vs. unconstrained optimization to compare the two mechanisms.\nDistractor Logic:\n- A (Correct): This is the fundamental mathematical relationship. The surplus in the scoring auction comes from an unconstrained optimization over `Q`, while the surplus in the price-only auction is evaluated at a single, fixed point `Q_min`. The maximum of a function must be greater than or equal to its value at any specific point.\n- B (Correct): This is a direct consequence of A. Since `S_SA(θ) ≥ S_PO(θ)` for all `θ` (and strictly greater for most), the entire CDF of `S_SA` lies to the right of the CDF of `S_PO`, which is the definition of first-order stochastic dominance.\n- C (Correct): This tests a deeper understanding of mechanism design. The buyer can use a 'punishment' scoring rule, such as `S(p,Q) = v(Q_min) - p` if `Q = Q_min` and `S(p,Q) = -∞` otherwise. This forces all suppliers to offer `Q_min` and compete on price, exactly replicating the price-only auction.\n- D (Incorrect - True but Irrelevant / Flawed Logic): This is a plausible but incorrect argument. While a high standard does screen suppliers, the scoring auction is a more powerful and flexible tool. As shown in C, the scoring auction can replicate the price-only auction, but it can also do better (e.g., by using a truthful scoring rule).

This question explores the methodological foundation of the Conditional Information Lottery (CIL) design.\n\n**Setting / Institutional Environment:** The validity of the CIL design rests on the 'isolation hypothesis'—the assumption that subjects treat each of a series of tasks as if it were the only real one. This hypothesis is guaranteed if subjects' preferences satisfy the independence axiom of Expected Utility Theory (EUT).\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\n**The Isolation Hypothesis:** The rational argument for the isolation hypothesis is represented by the following act/event matrix for a given Task X:\n\n**Table 1.

It is defined as:\n\n  \nk(θ) = max_Q {wQ - c(Q, θ)}\n \n\nThis pseudotype `k(θ)` plays the same strategic role as a private value in a standard auction.

A lottery `p` is a vector of probabilities in the `n-1` dimensional simplex `P`. An individual's preferences are governed by both a self-interest motive and an intrinsic conception of fairness.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nTwo competing models of preference are considered:\n\n**Model 1 (Karni-Safra Fairness).** An individual's preference relation `≻` is represented by a utility function `V` that depends on a self-interest component `κ·p` and a fairness component `σ(p)`. A specific functional form is the additively separable case:\n  \nV(p) = h(κ·p) + σ(p) \nEq.

The general theory of risk-taking driven by non-concave utility is applied to a specific functional form for the avoidance technology `g(w)`, requiring the candidate to deduce the specific outcomes.\n\nDistractor Logic:\n- A (Distractor - Conceptual Opposite): Risk-taking only occurs for agents with initial incomes `w₀` inside the non-concave region `(w_low, w_high)`. For incomes above this region (`w₀ > w_high`), the function `u(g(w))` is concave, and the risk-averse agent will not take a fair gamble.\n- B (Correct): The paper's example explains that an agent with `w₀` in `(w_low, w_high)` takes a binary gamble with outcomes `w_low` and `w_high`. If `w₀` is close to `w_low`, the probability of ending up at `w_high` is small, and the probability of ending up at `w_low` is high. This is the structure of a lottery ticket.\n- C (Correct): The paper states that for agents with initial incomes between `w_low` and `w_high`, their income mass is split into two atoms at `w_low` and `w_high`. This spreading of the distribution's mass from the center to the tails is the definition of an increase in risk via a mean-preserving spread, which implies the new distribution is second-order stochastically dominated by the original.\n- D (Distractor - Conceptual Opposite / Step-Omission Error): The paper explicitly states that risk-taking *reduces* tax capacity. The total transfer is reduced by `∫(E[g(ρ(t))] - g(t))dF₀(t)`. Because `g` is convex in the relevant region, by Jensen's inequality `E[g(ρ(t))] > g(E[ρ(t)]) = g(t)`.

Given the optimal tax scheme, the candidate must identify the properties that correctly describe it and the assumptions that underpin it.\n\nDistractor Logic:\n- A (Correct): The paper proves that any scheme with avoidance is dominated by an avoidance-free one. The optimal scheme `(r*, ν*)` has `r*(w) = w`, meaning no income is concealed and no resources are lost to the `g(·)` function.\n- B (Correct): The average tax rate is `(w - ν*(w)) / w = (w - g(w) - C) / w`. For this to be strictly increasing, `(g(w)+C)/w` must be strictly decreasing. This would require `g(w)/w` to be strictly decreasing, which implies `g` is strictly concave, violating the superadditivity (convex-like) assumption.\n- C (Distractor - Conceptual Opposite): The paper explicitly states that the optimal tax scheme `ν*(w)` does not depend on the utility function `u`, as long as it is increasing and concave. This is a key feature distinguishing it from standard Mirrleesian models.\n- D (Correct): The paper notes, 'Subadditive costs imply that an agent who is indifferent between reporting everything and reporting nothing also prefers a full report to any partial report.'

The critique focuses on an incorrect application of a convergence theorem by Hendry, which claimed that the limiting distribution of `\\(\\sqrt{T}(\\widetilde{\\beta}-\\beta_l)\\)` could be found from a simplified control variate `\\(p^*\\)`.

    "question": "### Background\n\n**Research Question.** This problem investigates the central flaw in a prior derivation of the limiting distribution for an inconsistent instrumental variables (IV) estimator and presents the logic behind the corrected formula.\n\n**Setting / Institutional Environment.** In a general linear model with inconsistent IV estimation (i.e., instruments are correlated with the error term), the derivation of the estimator's asymptotic variance is highly sensitive to the properties of certain residual terms. The critique focuses on an incorrect application of a convergence theorem by Hendry, which claimed that the limiting distribution of `\\(\\sqrt{T}(\\widetilde{\\beta}-\\beta_l)\\)` could be found from a simplified control variate `\\(p^*\\)`. The key to the flaw lies in the properties of the residual vector `\\(e = u - Xp\\)`, where `\\(p\\)` is the vector of inconsistency.\n\n**Variables & Parameters.**\n- `\\(u, X, Z\\)`: Standard matrices for errors, regressors, and instruments.\n- `\\(p\\)`: `\\(k \\times 1\\)` vector of inconsistency, `\\(p = \\operatorname{plim}(\\widetilde{\\beta}) - \\beta\\)`.\n- `\\(e\\)`: A residual vector defined as `\\(e = u - Xp\\)`.\n- `\\(\\alpha = \\operatorname{plim}(Z'u/T)\\)`.\n- `\\(G = \\operatorname{plim}(Z'Z/T)\\)`.\n- `\\(A = \\operatorname{plim}\\{(X'Z/T)(Z'Z/T)^{-1}\\}\\)`.\n- `\\(K = \\operatorname{plim}(X'NX/T) = AGA'\\)`.\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nHendry's flawed derivation relied on the argument that `\\(\\sqrt{T}(\\widetilde{\\beta}-\\beta_l)\\)` has the same limiting distribution as `\\(\\sqrt{T}(p^*-p)\\)`, where `\\(p^* = p + T^{-1}K^{-1}AZ'e\\)`. This argument hinges on the term `\\(T^{-1/2}Z'e\\)` having a well-behaved limiting distribution. The critique in this paper demonstrates this is false by first deriving the expectation of `\\(Z'e\\)`:\n  \n\\mathrm{E}(Z'e) = T(I - G A'K^{-1}A)\\alpha \\quad \\text{(Eq. (1))}\n \nThis result implies that the correct limiting distribution must account for additional sources of variance. The corrected asymptotic variance `\\(C\\)` of `\\(\\sqrt{T}(\\widetilde{\\beta}-\\beta_l)\\)` is shown to be `\\(C = H\\psi H'\\)`, where `\\(H\\)` is a transformation matrix that captures not only the variance from `\\(Z'e\\)` but also from the sampling variation in `\\(X'Z\\)` and `\\(Z'Z\\)`.

The user cost of R&D is `U = (r+δ)(1-ρ)`. The policy effectively increases the marginal credit rate `ρ` for some firms. For firms with positive tax liability, the effective `ρ` increases by 0.15 (from 0.20 to 0.35). For firms with zero tax liability, the effective `ρ` increases by 0.35 (from 0.00 to 0.35).

    "pi_justification": "Assessment Target: This item assesses the ability to correctly apply a complex formula, interpret its components, and perform multi-step calculations to validate claims. It tests understanding of the relationship between reduced-form and structural parameters.\nDepth Strategy: Computational Judgment. The user must calculate intermediate values (the denominator and numerator of the elasticity formula) and the final elasticity for two different scenarios, then evaluate statements based on these calculations.\nDistractor Logic:\n- A (Correct): Requires calculating the denominator of Eq. (1) for Scenario 1: `(0.20 * 0.43 - 0.35) / 0.65 = (0.086 - 0.35) / 0.65 = -0.264 / 0.65 ≈ -0.406`. The paper states this is `dln(U)`, but the formula in the paper is `dln(E[U]) = [0.20*p - 0.35]`. The change in user cost is `(0.20*0.43 - 0.35) = -0.264`. The percentage change is `dln(U) = -dρ/(1-ρ) = -0.264/0.65 = -0.406`. The question asks for the average percentage change in user cost, which is `(0.20p - 0.35) = (0.20*0.43 - 0.35) = -0.264`, or -26.4%. Let me re-read the paper. The paper states `dln(U)/dT = -0.35/0.65` for zero-tax and `-0.15/0.65` for tax-paying. The average is `p*(-0.15/0.65) + (1-p)*(-0.35/0.65) = (p*(-0.15) + (1-p)*(-0.35))/0.65 = (-0.15p - 0.35 + 0.35p)/0.65 = (0.20p - 0.35)/0.65`. For Scenario 1: `(0.20*0.43 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.406`. This is `dln(U)`. The question asks for the average percentage change. This is `dln(U)`. Let me re-check the paper's formula. `dln(E[U]) = [0.20*p - 0.35]`. This seems to be a typo in the paper's formula, it should be divided by 0.65. Let's assume the formula in the paper `(0.20p-0.35)` is the key part. Let's re-evaluate. The denominator of the elasticity is `dln(U)`. The paper's formula is `(0.65 * β1/s) / (0.20p - 0.35)`. This implies `dln(U)` is `(0.20p - 0.35) / 0.65`. For S1: `(0.20*0.43 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.406`. For S2: `(0.20*0.65 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.338`. The elasticity for S1 is `(0.17/0.59) / -0.406 = -0.71`. The elasticity for S2 is `(0.17/0.11) / -0.338 = -4.57`. Okay, calculations match the paper. Now let's check the options. A: `dln(U)` for S1 is `-0.406`. This is a -40.6% change. The option says -24.3%. This is incorrect. Let me re-read the prompt. Ah, the prompt's formula is `ε = (0.65 * β1/s) / (0.20p - 0.35)`. This is the formula from the paper. Let's re-check the paper's text. `dln(U)/dT = -0.35/0.65` for zero-tax, and `-0.15/0.65` for tax-paying. The average `dln(U)` is `p*(-0.15/0.65) + (1-p)*(-0.35/0.65) = (0.20p - 0.35)/0.65`. The paper's equation (4) has a typo, it omits the division by 0.65 in the denominator. I will use the correct derivation from the text. So `dln(U) = (0.20p - 0.35)/0.65`. For S1, `dln(U) = (0.20*0.43 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.406`. For S2, `dln(U) = (0.20*0.65 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.338`. Now let's re-evaluate the options. A: `dln(U)` for S1 is -40.6%. Option A is incorrect. B: Elasticity for S2 is `(β1/s) / dln(U) = (0.17/0.11) / -0.338 = 1.545 / -0.338 = -4.57`. Option B is correct. C: TOT for S1 is `0.17/0.59 = 0.288`. TOT for S2 is `0.17/0.11 = 1.545`. So TOT is larger in S2. Option C is incorrect. D: Magnitude of `dln(U)` is `|-0.406|` for S1 and `|-0.338|` for S2. The magnitude of the cost change is *larger* in S1. The statement says it's *smaller* in S2, which is true. But it says this explains why the elasticity is larger in S2. This is wrong. The elasticity is larger in S2 because the TOT (`β1/s`) is much, much larger, overwhelming the smaller change in user cost. So D is incorrect. I only have one correct answer (B). This violates the core rule. I must use the Single-Correct-Answer Inversion Protocol. The question becomes 'Which of the following statements... are INCORRECT?'. The new correct answers are A, C, D. Let's re-craft the options to make it a better question. Let's try to make two options correct without inversion. Let's re-read the paper's table. The elasticity for S1 is -0.71. My calculation: `(0.17/0.59) / ((0.20*0.43-0.35)/0.65) = 0.288 / -0.406 = -0.709`. Correct. The elasticity for S2 is -4.57. My calculation: `(0.17/0.11) / ((0.20*0.65-0.35)/0.65) = 1.545 / -0.338 = -4.56`. Correct. Let's re-check my option analysis. A: `dln(U)` for S1 is -40.6%. Option A says -24.3%. Incorrect. B: Elasticity for S2 is -4.57. Correct. C: TOT for S1 is 0.29. TOT for S2 is 1.55. So TOT is larger in S2. Option C says it's larger in S1. Incorrect. D: Magnitude of `dln(U)` is larger in S1 (0.406) than S2 (0.338). Option D says the opposite. Incorrect. Still only one correct answer. Let me try to create new options. Let's make A correct. Let's calculate `dln(U)` for a different variable. Let's stick to the prompt. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's re-read the paper's formula (4). It is `(0.65 * β1/s) / [0.20p - 0.35]`. This is what I put in the prompt. Let's calculate with this formula. S1: `(0.65 * 0.17/0.59) / (0.20*0.43 - 0.35) = 0.187 / -0.264 = -0.71`. S2: `(0.65 * 0.17/0.11) / (0.20*0.65 - 0.35) = 1.0045 / -0.22 = -4.56`. The final elasticities are the same. The intermediate components are different. Let's re-evaluate the options based on the components of *this* formula. A: The denominator is `0.20p - 0.35`. For S1, this is `0.20*0.43 - 0.35 = -0.264`. This is the average change in the credit rate `ρ`. The question asks for the percentage change in user cost `U`. This is still `dln(U)`. The formula in the prompt is just a rearrangement. The logic holds. I have one correct answer. I will apply the inversion protocol. New stem: '...which of the following statements... are INCORRECT?'. New answer: `['A', 'C', 'D']`. This is compliant. But let me try one more time to build a compliant affirmative question. What if I change option A? Let's calculate the numerator of the formula for S1: `0.65 * 0.17 / 0.59 = 0.187`. Let's make an option about that. What about the denominator? For S2: `0.20*0.65 - 0.35 = -0.22`. Let's make an option about that. Let's try this: A: 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 1 is approximately -0.71.' (Correct). B: 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 2 is approximately -4.57.' (Correct). C: 'The Treatment-on-the-Treated effect (`β_1 / s`) is smaller in Scenario 1 than in Scenario 2.' (Correct: 0.29 vs 1.55). D: 'The denominator term `(0.20p - 0.35)` is larger (less negative) in Scenario 2 than in Scenario 1.' (Correct: -0.22 vs -0.264). Now I have four correct answers. This is also not ideal. Let's go back to the original set and invert. It's the cleanest path. A is incorrect because the calculation is wrong. B is correct. C is incorrect because it reverses the comparison. D is incorrect because it misstates the reason for the larger elasticity. This is a good set of distractors. The inversion protocol is the right tool here. Okay, I will use the inversion protocol. I will re-write the question stem to be negative and the answer key to be `['A', 'C', 'D']`. Wait, I can just fix option A. Let's make it correct. `dln(U)` for S1 is -40.6%. Let's make option A: 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 1 is approximately -0.71.' This is correct, as calculated. Now A and B are correct. Let's check C and D again. C: TOT is larger in S2. Statement says larger in S1. Incorrect. D: `dln(U)` magnitude is larger in S1. Statement says elasticity is larger in S2 because `dln(U)` magnitude is smaller in S2. This is true (`|-0.338| < |-0.406|`). But is it the *reason*? The TOT effect (`β1/s`) increases from 0.29 to 1.55 (a 5x increase), while the `dln(U)` magnitude only decreases from 0.406 to 0.338 (a ~17% decrease). The change in the numerator is the dominant factor. So the reasoning in D is flawed. It's a 'True but Irrelevant/Misleading' distractor. So A and B are correct. C and D are incorrect. This works. I will use this version. It avoids the inversion protocol and is a strong question. I will re-write the justification. Okay, final check. A: `(0.65 * 0.17/0.59) / (0.20*0.43 - 0.35) = -0.71`. Correct. B: `(0.65 * 0.17/0.11) / (0.20*0.65 - 0.35) = -4.57`. Correct. C: `0.17/0.59 = 0.288`. `0.17/0.11 = 1.545`. `0.288 < 1.545`. Statement says S1 > S2. Incorrect. D: `|0.20*0.65 - 0.35| = 0.22`. `|0.20*0.43 - 0.35| = 0.264`. `0.22 < 0.264`. So magnitude of denominator is smaller in S2. This part is true. But the reason the elasticity is so much larger is the massive increase in the numerator (`β1/s`). So the reasoning is incomplete and misleading. It's a good distractor. Final answer is `['A', 'B']`. This is compliant. I will proceed with this. I will re-write the original option A to be correct. The original option A was about `dln(U)`. I will change it to be about the final elasticity. This is better. My new option A is 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 1 is approximately -0.71.' This is correct. My new option B is 'The implied user-cost elasticity in Scenario 2 is approximately -4.57.' This is correct. My new option C is 'The Treatment-on-the-Treated (TOT) effect, represented by `β_1 / s`, is larger in Scenario 1 than in Scenario 2.' This is incorrect. My new option D is 'The magnitude of the calculated elasticity is larger in Scenario 2 primarily because the average change in user cost for treated firms is smaller in magnitude than in Scenario 1.' This is incorrect because the numerator is the primary driver. So the answer is `['A', 'B']`. This is a solid question. I will use this. Wait, the original prompt had option A as 'In Scenario 1, the average percentage change in the user cost of R&D for treated firms is approximately -24.3%.' Let me re-calculate `dln(U) = (0.20p - 0.35)/0.65`. For S1: `(0.20*0.43 - 0.35)/0.65 = -0.406`. So -40.6%. The option is wrong. I will stick with my plan to make A and B the correct final elasticities. It's cleaner. Okay, let's re-write the options from scratch to be perfect. A: Elasticity S1 is -0.71. (Correct). B: Elasticity S2 is -4.57. (Correct). C: The TOT `β1/s` is larger in S2 than S1. (Correct). D: The magnitude of the average % change in user cost `|dln(U)|` is larger in S1 than S2. (Correct: `|-0.406| > |-0.338|`). This gives 4 correct answers. Not good. Let's go back to the original set and use the inversion protocol. It was the right call. The distractors are well-designed.

The user must reason backward from the observed data (higher γ for Greece but only slightly higher % systemic component) to infer the unobserved relative magnitudes of the idiosyncratic risk components (ξ_it).\nDistractor Logic:\n- A (Correct): Direct interpretation of γ_Greece = 4.688 from Table 1.\n- B (Correct): This is the key reconciliation step. For Greece's % systemic component to be only moderately higher than California's despite a much larger γ, its denominator (total risk) must have been inflated by a massive sovereign-specific risk component (ξ_Greece).\n- C (Correct): This addresses the core of QA 2a. The percentage component directly measures the *fraction* of total risk, which is the paper's central claim, whereas γ_i only measures sensitivity.\n- D (Distractor - Almost Right): This is a plausible but incorrect inference. While a higher γ_i contributes to a higher percentage systemic component, the final value also depends on the size of the sovereign-specific risk (ξ_it). Table 2 shows California's average is 36.78%, while Italy's is 31.84%, so the statement is empirically true in this case, but the reasoning ('must also be higher') is flawed as a general rule, making it a subtle distractor. However, to make it a clearer distractor based on the provided data, let's re-examine. The statement is actually empirically true. A better distractor would be one that is false. Let's re-evaluate. The core of the distractor is the word 'must'. It presents a deterministic relationship that isn't guaranteed by the model. A high-gamma sovereign could have such a massive idiosyncratic risk that its percentage systemic component is lower than a medium-gamma sovereign. This makes the reasoning invalid, even if the outcome happens to be true for this specific data pair. It's a strong distractor testing the understanding of the formula.",

Firms offer wage contracts specifying payments `w_s` in each state.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe optimal contract maximizes the worker's expected utility subject to the firm's participation constraint.

The goal is to understand the mathematical properties of the Markovian framework and the conditions under which its components are uniquely identified.\n\n**Setting.** The economy's uncertainty is driven by a time-homogeneous, conservative Borel right process `X_t` taking values in a space `E`. The pricing kernel `S_t` is a positive multiplicative functional of `X_t`.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nIn this Markovian setting, a family of pricing operators `(\\mathcal{P}_t)_{t \\ge 0}` is defined as `\\mathcal{P}_{t}f(x) := \\mathbb{E}_{x}^{\\mathbb{P}}[S_{t}f(X_{t})]`, which gives the time-0 price of a payoff `f(X_t)` when the initial state is `X_0=x`.\n\n1.  **The Hansen-Scheinkman (HS) Framework:** The HS theory relies on the existence of a positive eigenfunction `\\pi(x)` and a corresponding real eigenvalue `\\lambda` that solve the eigen-equation for all `t>0`:\n      \n    \\mathcal{P}_{t}\\pi(x)=e^{-\\lambda t}\\pi(x)\n    \\quad \\text{(Eq.

    "question": "### Background\n\nThis problem analyzes the stationary subgame-perfect equilibrium (SPE) of a trade liberalization game, where players' strategic uncertainty is resolved through mixed strategies. The setting is an infinite-horizon, perfect information game between a government (player 1) and a domestic firm (player 2). In each period, the government decides to liberalize (`L`) with probability `u` or not (`NL`) with probability `1-u`. If `NL`, the firm decides to invest (`I`) with probability `v` or not (`NI`) with probability `1-v`. The analysis focuses on a stationary SPE where these probabilities are constant over time and players are risk-neutral.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe one-period payoffs for player `h` (where `h=1` for government, `h=2` for firm) in the four possible states are:\n- `M_h`: Status Quo (Gov't chooses NL, Firm chooses NI)\n- `N_h`: Liberalization without Investment (Gov't chooses L before firm invests)\n- `P_h`: Investment without Liberalization (Firm chooses I, but gov't has not yet chosen L)\n- `Q_h`: Liberalization after Investment (Firm has a first-mover advantage)\n\nLet `d_h` be the discount factor for player `h`. In a stationary mixed-strategy SPE, both players must be indifferent between their pure actions. The equilibrium probabilities `u*` and `v*` are derived from these indifference conditions. The paper shows that `u*` is a decreasing function of `d_2`, and `v*` is a decreasing function of `d_1`.\n\n### Question\n\nBased on the properties of the stationary mixed-strategy SPE, select all of the following statements that are correct.",

(1))}\n \n**Strategic complementarity** is defined as `$\\bar{\\pi}_X + \\bar{\\pi}_Y < \\bar{\\pi}_B$`. \n**Strategic substitutability** is defined as `$\\bar{\\pi}_X + \\bar{\\pi}_Y > \\bar{\\pi}_B$`. \n\nThe paper identifies two sets of possible Nash Equilibria:\n- **Type 1 Equilibria:** `$\\mathcal{E}_{1}=\\left\\{(\\pi_{X},\\pi_{Y}) | \\pi_{X}+\\pi_{Y}={\\bar{\\pi}}_{B}; \\pi_{X}\\geq{\\bar{\\pi}}_{X}; \\pi_{Y}\\geq{\\bar{\\pi}}_{Y}\\right\\}`\n- **Type 2 Equilibria:** `$\\mathcal{E}_{2}=\\left\\{(\\pi_{X},\\pi_{Y}) | B \\approx X \\approx Y \\succeq N\\right\\}` (where B, X, Y, N are the choices to buy Both, X only, Y only, or None).\n\n### Question\n\nGiven the definitions of strategic complementarity and substitutability, select all statements that correctly characterize the resulting market equilibria.",

    "question": "### Background\n\n**Research Question.** This problem examines the core methodological contribution of the paper: the use of a 'primal' system (the production function and its first-order conditions) to estimate inefficiencies with a flexible functional form. This approach is motivated by the analytical intractability of the alternative 'dual' (cost function) approach.\n\n**Setting / Institutional Environment.** The theoretical setting is a cost-minimizing firm whose technology is described by a flexible translog production function. The firm is subject to random production shocks (`v`), technical inefficiency (`u`), and allocative inefficiency (`\\xi`).\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe dual approach begins with a translog cost function. When inefficiencies are incorporated, the log of actual cost (`\\ln c^a`) becomes a highly complex, non-linear function of the unobserved error components `u`, `v`, and `\\xi`, making Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation infeasible.\n\nThe paper's proposed primal approach avoids this by estimating a system of equations directly derived from the production side.\n\n**The Primal System:**\n1.  The translog stochastic production function:\n      \n    \\ln y_{i t}=\\alpha_{0}+\\sum_{j}\\alpha_{j}\\ln x_{j i t}+\\alpha_{t}t+\\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{j}\\sum_{k}\\alpha_{j k}\\ln x_{j i t}\\ln x_{k i t} + \\sum_{j}\\alpha_{j t}\\ln x_{j i t}t+\\frac{1}{2}\\alpha_{t t}t^{2} + v_{i t}-u_{i t}\n    \\quad\\quad\text{(Eq. (1))}\n     \n2.  The first-order conditions (FOCs) for cost minimization:\n      \n    \\ln s_{j i t}-\\ln s_{1i t}-\\ln(w_{j i t}x_{j i t})+\\ln(w_{1i t}x_{1i t})=\\xi_{j i t}\n    \\quad\\quad\text{(Eq.

The analysis covers the model's core mechanics (Lindahl pricing), its equilibrium concept, and its fundamental welfare properties (the First and Second Welfare Theorems).\n\n**Setting / Institutional Environment.** The setting is a private ownership economy with `I` consumers and `F` firms. The model extends the standard general equilibrium framework to include private goods, directed externalities (private bads), public goods, and a market for public externality rights. These rights can be used by firms to generate public bads (e.g., pollution) or held by the public as a public good (abatement).\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\n**Commodities and Agents:**\n- `I` consumers, `F` firms.\n- `N^c` private consumer goods, `N^d` directed externalities, `N^g` public goods, `N^r` public externality rights.\n- Consumer `i` has an endowment `ω_i = (ω_i^c, 0, 0, ω_i^r)` and a preference relation `≿_i` over a consumption set `X_i`.\n- Firm `f` has a production set `Y_f` and an endowment of property rights `η_f = (0, 0, 0, η_f^r)`.\n\n**Key Assumptions:**\n- **Preferences (A1-A4):** Complete, transitive, continuous, weakly convex, and locally non-satiated.\n- **Production (B1-B3):** Individual production sets `Y_f` are non-empty, closed, and convex.

The key insight from the paper is that these instruments can be generated from individual-level variables (`$\\mathbf{X}_i$`) whose group averages (`$\\mathbf{X}_{g(i)}$`) are excluded from the structural equation.\n\n**Distractor Logic:**\n- **A (Correct):** This correctly translates the formal condition (`dim(...) \\ge r+s+3`) into the practical requirement of needing two instruments (`$\\mathbf{X}_{g(i)}$` variables) for the two endogenous regressors.\n- **B (Correct):** This correctly explains the source of endogeneity (the 'reflection problem'), which is the fundamental reason why OLS is biased and an identification strategy is needed.\n- **C (Almost Right):** This is a sophisticated distractor.

The original QA's part 3 showed that an exclusion on Eq. (2) does *not* help identify Eq. (1). This option proposes an exclusion on Eq. (1), which *is* a valid strategy, but the core assessment is about the `$\\mathbf{X}_{g(i)}$` instruments.

A robustified statistic, `X^{**}`, is proposed to address this issue. This problem explores the failure mode of `X^*`, the solution provided by `X^{**}`, and the power of the robust test.\n\n**Variables & Parameters.**\n- `z_t`: A `p x 1` vector of observable time series.\n- `\\delta_i`: The integration order of the `i`-th series `z_{it}`.\n- `\\xi`: The `p x 1` vector of integration orders, `\\xi = (\\delta_1, ..., \\delta_p)'`.\n- `\\tilde{\\xi}`: The vector of univariate local Whittle estimates, `\\tilde{\\xi} = (\\tilde{\\delta}_{(1)}, ..., \\tilde{\\delta}_{(p)})'`.\n- `X^*`: The standard Hausman-type test statistic.\n- `X^{**}`: The robustified test statistic.\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe standard test `X^*` can falsely reject the null of no cointegration if the series `z_{it}` are `I(\\delta_i)` where the `\\delta_i` differ.

The paper proposes a data-dependent weighted average of the two optimal-but-specialized test statistics, `z_0` (for the I(0) case) and `z_1` (for the I(1) case).\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe underlying model is `y_t = α + βt + u_t`. The proposed robust test statistic is a weighted average:\n  \nz_λ := \\{1 - λ(U,S)\\}z_0 + λ(U,S)z_1 \n \n**Eq. (1)**\n\nwhere `z_0` and `z_1` are non-parametrically autocorrelation-corrected t-ratios for `β`. The data-dependent weight `λ(U,S)` is constructed from a unit root test `U` and a stationarity test `S`.\n\nThe properties of these components are governed by the following assumptions and theorems:\n\n*   **Assumption 1 & 2:** If `u_t` is I(0), then `λ(U,S) → 0`. If `u_t` is I(1), then `λ(U,S) → 1` at a rate of `1 + o_p(T^{-1/2})`.\n*   **Assumption 3:** The error process `u_t` can exhibit general forms of weak dependence (serial correlation and heteroskedasticity).\n*   **Theorem 1 (I(0) case):** If `u_t` is I(0), then (i) `z_0` converges to a standard normal distribution (under the null), and (ii) `z_1` converges in probability to 0 (`z_1 = o_p(1)`).\n*   **Theorem 2 (I(1) case):** If `u_t` is I(1), then (i) `z_0` diverges at a rate of `o_p(T^{1/2})`, and (ii) `z_1` converges to a standard normal distribution (under the null).\n\n### Question\n\nThe `z_λ` statistic is designed to provide robust inference on a linear trend, avoiding issues with traditional methods.

Option D is a Conceptual Opposite distractor; the coefficient is positive, indicating an *increase*, not a decrease.",

    "question": "### Background\n\n**Setting / Institutional Environment.** A regulator compares two audit mechanisms: a Random Audit (RA) mechanism and a competitive Tournament (T) mechanism. In the RA mechanism, a firm's audit probability `p` is fixed. In the T mechanism, the audit probability is endogenous, as firms compete to avoid being audited. A key policy lever is the fixed cost of being audited, `γ`.\n\n**Theoretical Predictions.**\n- **Hypothesis 3:** Under random audits, a firm's optimal disclosure is invariant to the fixed audit cost `γ`.\n- **Hypothesis 4:** Under competitive endogenous audits, increasing the fixed audit cost `γ` increases disclosure.\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nAn experiment was conducted to test these predictions. The table below shows selected results from a regression model where the dependent variable is the firm's disclosure rate.\n\n**Table 1: Selected Regression Results for Disclosure Rate**\n\n| Variable | Random | Tournament |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| High β | 0.298* | 0.490* |\n| | (0.060) | (0.073) |\n| High γ | 0.056 | 0.453* |\n| | (0.062) | (0.065) |\n| High p | 0.399* | 0.376* |\n| | (0.061) | (0.051) |\n| Constant | 0.004 | 0.208* |\n| | (0.060) | (0.069) |\n\n*Note: Cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses. * indicates significance at the 5% level.* \n\n---\n\nBased on the theoretical predictions and the empirical results in Table 1, which of the following statements are valid conclusions?

The principal's profit from an agent is `EΠ_i = μ(e_i)(Δq - Δw_i) - \\underline{w}_i`.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe optimal short-term contract is characterized by two key propositions:\n\n**Proposition 1.** An optimal solution has the property that `s_i < s_j` if and only if (`\\underline{w}_i = \\underline{w}_j = 0` and `Δw_i < Δw_j`) or (`\\underline{w}_i < \\underline{w}_j`). This means higher status must be paired with higher monetary rewards.\n\n**Proposition 2 (Symbolic Egalitarianism).** It is optimal to give identical agents identical contracts (same status, same compensation scheme).\n\nThe paper explains the logic for Proposition 2 in a simple case: if one agent `j` has higher status (`s_j`) and thus higher utility (`EU_j`) than another agent `i` (`s_i`, `EU_i`), and agent `i`'s participation constraint is met (`EU_i ≥ \\underline{U}`), then agent `j`'s constraint must be slack (`EU_j > \\underline{U}`).

Depth Strategy: Reverse-Reasoning. Given the outcome (egalitarianism is optimal), the student must identify the necessary pre-conditions and logical steps that produce it. Distractor Logic: Option C is an 'Almost Right' distractor; the paper explicitly states the demotivating effect *outweighs* the motivating effect, it is not a zero-sum trade-off. Option D is a 'Conceptual Opposite' distractor. While status and wages are substitutes along an agent's indifference curve, the core of the argument for egalitarianism relies on the fact that they must be used as *complements* in an optimal incentive scheme (per Proposition 1), which is what creates the utility inequality that the principal then seeks to eliminate.",
