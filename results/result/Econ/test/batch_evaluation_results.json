In Stage 1, a manufacturer (M) makes simultaneous, secret, take-it-or-leave-it nonlinear contract offers, `T_i`, to two retailers (`R_1`, `R_2`). In Stage 2, after accepting or rejecting the contracts, retailers compete by simultaneously choosing their prices (`p_i`) and sales effort levels (`e_i`).

Would this dynamic consideration make the predictions of the 'contract equilibrium' concept more or less robust as a description of long-run market outcomes? Justify your reasoning.",
            "Answer": "1.  The condition \"taking `(T_j*, s_j*)` as given\" means that when the `M-R_i` pair secretly considers an alternative contract `T'_i`, they assume that retailer `R_j` will not observe this deviation. Consequently, `R_j` will continue to operate under its original contract `T_j*` and play its original strategy `s_j*`. This assumption is central to the opportunism problem because it creates a temptation for the manufacturer. For instance, `M` can offer `R_i` a contract that encourages `R_i` to lower its price and steal business from `R_j`. The profitability of this deviation relies on `R_j` not anticipating it and thus not changing its own price in response. This incentive for `M` to secretly play one retailer off against the other is the core of the opportunism problem.\n\n2.  A multilateral deviation is a simultaneous, secret change by the manufacturer to the contracts offered to *both* retailers, `R_1` and `R_2`. A contract equilibrium, by definition, is immune to bilateral deviations but not necessarily to multilateral ones. For example, suppose the retailers' prices are strategic substitutes. A bilateral deviation where `M` induces `R_1` to raise its price might be unprofitable, because `R_2` (holding its contract fixed) would not follow suit and would instead capture market share. However, a multilateral deviation where `M` secretly offers new contracts to *both* `R_1` and `R_2` that incentivize both to raise their prices could be profitable. Each retailer might accept the new contract, believing the other is still operating under the old terms, but the manufacturer, by deceiving both, can coordinate a move to a more profitable, less competitive market outcome.\n\n3.  In a repeated game setting, the manufacturer's ability to build a reputation would strongly disincentivize multilateral deviations. If the manufacturer engages in such a deviation, it might earn higher profits in the current period. However, once this behavior is eventually inferred or discovered, its reputation would be damaged. Future short-lived retailers, anticipating that the manufacturer cannot be trusted to honor the implicit terms of its agreements, would be less willing to accept contracts that are profitable for the manufacturer. They would demand terms that protect them against such secret manipulations, reducing the manufacturer's future profit stream. The potential loss of future profits due to a damaged reputation would act as a disciplining device. This makes the manufacturer less likely to undertake multilateral deviations. Consequently, the 'contract equilibrium' concept, which focuses on stability against bilateral deviations, becomes a *more robust* and plausible predictor of long-run outcomes, as the reputational mechanism effectively rules out the multilateral deviations that the static concept ignores.",

The auxiliary parametric model for `g_t(β̃)` is a good approximation.\n2.  The underlying data process `{X_t}` is fourth-order stationary.\n3.  The Mean Squared Error (MSE) of `β̂` is a well-defined and appropriate objective function.\n\n---\n\n### The Questions\n\n1. The proposed feasible procedure involves fitting a simple parametric model (e.g., univariate AR(1)s) to the moment residuals. Discuss the potential for misspecification error in this step. If the true process for the vector `g_t` has strong cross-moment correlations (non-diagonal long-run variance), how might this simplified approach lead to a biased estimate of the optimal bandwidth `Ŝ_T`?\n\n2. The entire theoretical derivation relies on an assumption of fourth-order stationarity. Consider estimating a model with US macroeconomic data from 1960-2020, a period that includes the \"Great Moderation\" (a structural break reducing volatility post-1980s). Explain why this likely violates the stationarity assumption and analyze the consequences for the validity of a single optimal bandwidth `S_T^*` computed over the whole sample.\n\n3. The paper's goal is to minimize the MSE of `β̂`. However, a well-known result for linear IV estimators is that moments of order `k` exist only if `k < l-p+1`, where `l` is the number of instruments and `p` is the number of parameters. If a researcher works with a model where `l-p=1` (one overidentifying restriction), the true MSE of `β̂` is infinite. Discuss the profound implications of this for the paper's entire objective. Is minimizing an *asymptotic approximation* of an infinite quantity a valid procedure? Justify your position and suggest a more appropriate loss function for such a scenario.",
            "Answer": "1. Fitting univariate AR(1) models to each moment residual implicitly assumes that the long-run variance-covariance matrix of the moment vector, `Ω₀`, is diagonal. If the true process for `g_t` has strong cross-moment correlations, this assumption is false. The procedure incorrectly sets all off-diagonal elements of `Ω₀` to zero, leading to a biased estimate `Ω̂₀`. This misspecification will bias the estimates `ν̂₂` and `ν̂₃`, which depend on `Ω̂₀`. The direction of the bias in `Ŝ_T` is ambiguous, but if the ignored cross-correlations are a major source of the system's overall persistence, the univariate models might underestimate it, potentially leading to a bandwidth `Ŝ_T` that is too small.\n\n2. The \"Great Moderation\" represents a structural break in the unconditional variance of key macroeconomic time series. This directly violates the assumption of stationarity, which requires that moments (including variance) are constant over time. The optimal bandwidth `S_T^*` is a function of the data's autocovariance structure (`Ω₀`). Since this structure is different in the pre- and post-moderation periods, a single `S_T^*` calculated using moments averaged over the entire sample will be a compromise. It will likely be **too small** for the more volatile, higher-persistence pre-moderation period (leading to a biased HAC estimate) and **too large** for the less volatile, lower-persistence post-moderation period (leading to a noisy HAC estimate). In neither sub-period would this single bandwidth be optimal.\n\n3. The fact that the MSE of `β̂` can be infinite has profound and damaging implications for the paper's objective. The Mean Squared Error is the second moment of the estimator. If a researcher has a model with `l-p=1`, Kinal's result implies the true MSE does not exist (it is infinite). \n\nIn this context, minimizing an *asymptotic approximation* of the MSE is a conceptually flawed procedure. The AMSE is being used as a proxy for a quantity that is infinite. While the AMSE itself may be finite, it has lost its justification as a meaningful measure of finite-sample estimator quality. The procedure becomes a mechanical exercise of minimizing a formula that no longer approximates the true object of interest.\n\nA more appropriate loss function in such a scenario would be one that is robust to thick-tailed distributions and does not rely on the existence of second moments. Suitable alternatives include:\n*   **Minimizing Median Absolute Error:** `E[|β̂ - β₀|]` (if the first moment exists) or focusing on the median of the estimator's distribution, which is well-defined even when the mean is not.\n*   **Optimizing Confidence Interval Properties:** Instead of point estimation, one could choose the bandwidth to minimize the coverage probability error or the length of confidence intervals. This approach, central to the \"fixed-b\" asymptotics literature, focuses on the properties of the estimator's distribution (e.g., quantiles) rather than its non-existent moments.",
