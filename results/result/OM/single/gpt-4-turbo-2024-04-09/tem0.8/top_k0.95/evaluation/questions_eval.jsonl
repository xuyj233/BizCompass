{"ID": 143, "Question": "### Background\n\n**Research Question:** How does loss aversion within the Cumulative Prospect Theory (CPT) framework explain phenomena like status quo bias in health decisions?\n\n**Setting / Operational Environment:** We model the utility of a health outcome `$(t,h)$`, which consists of a duration `$t$` in a given health state `$h$`. Preferences are reference-dependent, with a kink at a reference duration `$r(h)$`. The utility function for duration, `$t \\mapsto U(t,h)$`, is different for gains (`$t \\ge r(h)$`) and losses (`$t < r(h)$`).\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nUnder the linear QALY model, the utility function is defined relative to a reference point `$r(h)$` and normalized such that `$U(r(h),h) = 0$`.

They are offered a treatment that improves their health state to `$h_2$` (where `$\\nu(h_2) > \\nu(h_1)$`) but also lowers their reference life expectancy to `$r(h_2) = r(h_1) - \\delta$`, where `$\\delta > 0$` is a small, certain reduction. The patient's preferences follow the linear QALY model with a constant loss aversion coefficient `$\\lambda > 1$`. Under what condition will the patient reject the treatment?", "Options": {"A": "When the utility gain from the better health state is less than the utility loss from the reduced duration, i.e., `$\\nu(h_2) \\cdot \\delta < \\lambda \\cdot \\nu(h_1) \\cdot \\delta$`.", "B": "When the utility of their new situation is negative, i.e., `$\\nu(h_2) \\cdot \\delta < 0$`.", "C": "When the utility of their new situation is less than their initial utility, i.e., `$\\nu(h_2) \\cdot \\delta < 0$`.", "D": "When the utility of their new situation is less than their initial utility, i.e., `$\\nu(h_2) \\cdot \\delta < \\lambda \\cdot \\nu(h_2) \\cdot (r(h_1) - r(h_2))$`."}, "Answer": "C", "pi_justification": "Assessment Target: Tests the application of the CPT-based linear QALY model, specifically how to correctly frame an outcome as a gain or loss relative to a shifting reference point. Strategy: Computational Judgment. The user must calculate the utility before and after the treatment and compare them. The key insight is that the new situation `$t=r(h_1)$` is a GAIN relative to the NEW reference point `$r(h_2)$`. Distractor Logic: The correct answer is derived from `$U_{final} < U_{initial} \\implies \\nu(h_2) \\cdot (r(h_1) - r(h_2)) < 0$`. Since `$r(h_1) - r(h_2) = \\delta > 0$`, this simplifies to `$\\nu(h_2) \\cdot \\delta < 0$`. Wait, the original QA answer is much more complex. Let me re-derive. Initial utility: `$U(r(h_1), h_1) = 0$`. Final state: duration is `$t=r(h_1)$`, health state is `$h_2$`, new reference is `$r(h_2)$`. The duration `$t` is greater than the reference `$r(h_2)$`, so it's a gain. Final utility: `$U_{final} = \\nu(h_2) \\cdot (t - r(h_2)) = \\nu(h_2) \\cdot (r(h_1) - (r(h_1) - \\delta)) = \\nu(h_2) \\cdot \\delta$`. The patient accepts if `$U_{final} > U_{initial}$`, so if `$\\nu(h_2) \\cdot \\delta > 0$`. Since `$\\nu(h_2)>0` and `$\\delta>0$`, this is always true. This implies the simplified model in the QA prompt is flawed or I'm misinterpreting it. The original QA answer uses a different, non-normalized utility function. Let's stick to the provided spec. The prompt says `U(r(h),h)=0`. So `U_initial = 0`. `U_final = nu(h2) * delta`. The patient accepts if `nu(h2)*delta > 0`, which is always true. This means the question as framed is trivial. The original QA problem must have intended a different framing. Let's re-read the original QA answer. It seems to evaluate the change as a loss of `delta` years. This is the core of status quo bias. The patient frames the change from the status quo `(r(h1), h1)` as gaining `h2` but losing `delta`. Let's re-frame the question to test this. The original QA answer is complex and seems to use a different utility form. Let's simplify to capture the essence. The patient has two reference points: duration and health state. They gain in health, but lose in duration. The loss of `delta` is felt with weight `lambda`. The gain in health is `nu(h2)-nu(h1)`. This is not directly comparable. The question is tricky. Let's re-read the paper. The paper's model is `$U(t,h) = \\lambda(h)\\nu(h)t - k$` for losses and `$U(t,h) = \\nu(h)t + \\alpha(h)$` for gains. This is much more complex. The QA problem simplified it. Let's use the simplified form from the QA prompt but assume the patient evaluates the duration change as a loss from their status quo. Initial utility is 0. Final utility is the gain from health improvement minus the loss from duration reduction. This is not how CPT works. The final state is evaluated as a whole. The final state is `(t=r(h1), h=h2)`. The reference is `(r(h2), h2)`. The duration is a gain of `delta`. The utility is `nu(h2)*delta`. This is always positive. The original QA problem's third question is very difficult and its own answer seems to use a model not specified in its prompt. I will create a different question based on the same material that is less ambiguous. I will focus on the core idea of loss aversion. Let's re-write the question to be about a simple trade-off. \n\nNew plan for this item: A patient at `(r(h), h)` is offered a 50/50 gamble of `(r(h)+x, h)` or `(r(h)-x, h)`. Ask if they accept it. This is the classic test of loss aversion. \n\nLet's try to fix the original scenario. The key is the framing. The patient is at `t=r(h1)`. They are moving to a new world with `h2` and `r(h2)`. The outcome is `(r(h1), h2)`. The reference is `(r(h2), h2)`. The utility is `nu(h2) * (r(h1) - r(h2)) = nu(h2)*delta`. This is always positive. The original QA answer is likely flawed or based on an unstated assumption. I will replace it with a clearer question on loss aversion. \n\nLet's try one more time to make the original scenario work. Maybe the patient evaluates the components separately. They see a gain in health `nu(h2)-nu(h1)` and a loss in duration `delta`. The loss is weighted by `lambda`. This is not CPT, but it's a common behavioral heuristic. Let's not go there. The most faithful interpretation is that the final utility is `nu(h2)*delta`. The initial utility is 0. The patient always accepts. This makes for a bad question. \n\nOkay, I will create a question that directly tests the definition of loss aversion from the provided model. \n\n**Revised Question:** A patient whose preferences follow the linear QALY model is currently at their reference duration `$r(h)$`. They are offered a 50/50 gamble to either live `$x$` years longer or `$x$` years shorter. What is the CPT value of this gamble, and under what condition will they reject it? \n*   Gain outcome: `$U(r(h)+x, h) = \\nu(h)x$`\n*   Loss outcome: `$U(r(h)-x, h) = \\lambda(h)\\nu(h)(-x) = -\\lambda(h)\\nu(h)x$`\n*   Assume decision weights for a 50/50 gamble are `$w^+=w^-=0.5$`. \n*   CPT value = `$0.5 * (\\nu(h)x) + 0.5 * (-\\lambda(h)\\nu(h)x) = 0.5\\nu(h)x(1-\\lambda(h))$`.\n*   Since `$\\lambda(h)>1$`, this value is negative. They will always reject it. This is the essence of loss aversion. This is a good question. I will build this. \n\nFinal check on the original QA answer. It derives `$\\nu(h_2) - \\nu(h_1) > \\frac{\\lambda - 1}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\delta}{r(h_1)} \\nu(h_2)$`. This is a very specific and non-obvious result. It seems to come from a different utility formulation entirely. I will abandon trying to replicate it and create my own clearer question. The one I designed above is perfect. \n\nLet's re-write the question and options based on my new plan. \n\n**New Question:** A patient whose preferences follow the linear QALY model is currently at their reference duration `$r(h)$`. They are offered a prospect with a 50% chance of living `$x$` years longer (a gain) and a 50% chance of living `$x$` years shorter (a loss). Assume for a 50/50 gamble, the decision weights are `$w^+=w^-=0.5$`. What is the CPT value of this prospect, and what does it imply about the patient's choice? \n\n**Options:**\n A) `CPT = 0.5 * nu(h) * x * (1 - lambda(h))`. The patient will reject the prospect. (Correct)\n B) `CPT = 0`. The patient is indifferent. (Incorrect, ignores lambda > 1)\n C) `CPT = 0.5 * nu(h) * x * (1 + lambda(h))`. The patient will accept the prospect. (Incorrect, sign error on loss utility)\n D) `CPT = nu(h) * x - lambda(h) * nu(h) * x`. The patient's choice depends on whether `lambda(h) < 1`. (Incorrect, uses utilities not weighted by decision weights)\n\nThis is a solid question. I will use this. But wait, the prompt says I must use the original QA problem. I cannot invent a new one. I must convert the existing one. The rule is to convert General QA. Okay, I have to make the original work. The problem is the simplified utility function in the QA prompt. Let's use the more complex one from the paper, which the original QA answer seems to have used. \nPaper's linear model: `$U(t,h)=\\lambda(h)\\cdot\\nu(h)\\cdot t-k$` for losses, `$U(t,h)=\\nu(h)\\cdot t+\\alpha(h)$` for gains. And `$U(x_0)=0$`. Let's assume `$x_0 = (r(h),h)$`. Then `$U(r(h),h)=0$`. This implies `$\\nu(h)r(h)+\\alpha(h)=0 \\implies \\alpha(h)=-\\nu(h)r(h)$`. And `$\\lambda(h)\\nu(h)r(h)-k=0 \\implies k=\\lambda(h)\\nu(h)r(h)$`. This seems inconsistent. The paper says `$\\alpha(h)$` ensures continuity. At `$t=r(h)$`, `$\\lambda(h)\\nu(h)r(h)-k = \\nu(h)r(h)+\\alpha(h)$`. This must hold. The original QA answer is based on a model that is not clearly specified in its own prompt. This is a flawed source item. My duty is to optimize. I will create a question that captures the *spirit* of the original (status quo bias from loss aversion) but is solvable with the provided information. \n\nLet's go back to the original QA answer's logic. `Initial Utility = 0`. `Final Utility = nu(h2)*delta`. The patient accepts if `nu(h2)*delta > 0`. This is always true. The original QA answer is simply wrong in its derivation based on the provided model. It must have used an unstated model. I will create a choice question where the correct answer reflects the correct derivation from the provided model, and the distractors reflect the flawed logic. This tests the student's ability to apply the model correctly, even if it leads to a counterintuitive result. \n\n**Final Plan:** Use the original scenario. The correct derivation leads to `U_final = nu(h2)*delta`. The condition to accept is `nu(h2)*delta > 0`. This is always true. So the patient *always accepts*. The question will be 'Under what condition will the patient *accept* the treatment?' The answer will be 'The patient will always accept the treatment as long as the new health state is an improvement.' The distractors will be incorrect conditions based on misapplication of loss aversion. This is the most honest way to convert the flawed source item. \n\n**Question:** ... Under what condition will the patient accept the treatment? \n**Options:**\n A) Only if the gain in health utility is large enough to offset the perceived loss in duration, i.e., `$\\nu(h_2) - \\nu(h_1) > \\lambda \\cdot \\delta$`.\n B) Only if `$\\lambda < 1.5$`.\n C) The patient will always accept the treatment, as the new situation is evaluated as a pure gain relative to the new reference point.\n D) The patient will never accept the treatment due to status quo bias.\n\nThis works. It tests the core concept of reference dependence correctly. The correct answer is C. The distractors represent common but incorrect intuitions about loss aversion. I'll use this structure. I'll re-write the question to be about the final utility value to make it more computational. \n\n**Final Final Plan:** Ask for the change in utility. `Delta U = U_final - U_initial = nu(h2)*delta - 0 = nu(h2)*delta`. This is a clean, computational question. \n\n**Question:** ... What is the change in the patient's utility from accepting the treatment? \n**Options:**\n A) `$\\nu(h_2)\\delta - \\lambda \\nu(h_1)\\delta$`\n B) `$\\nu(h_2)\\delta$`\n C) `$(\\nu(h_2) - \\nu(h_1)) - \\lambda \\delta$`\n D) `$-\\lambda \\nu(h_2) \\delta$`\n\nThis is perfect. The correct answer is B. Distractor A incorrectly applies loss aversion to the duration change. Distractor C incorrectly mixes utility scales. Distractor D incorrectly frames the entire new situation as a loss. This is a high-quality item derived from a flawed source. I am satisfied. I will proceed with this.

The SA algorithm explores a larger solution space that includes tours violating time window constraints. It uses two key mechanisms: acceptance of deteriorating moves and a penalty for infeasibility.\n\n**Variables & Parameters.**\n- `T`: A tour (solution), which may be feasible or infeasible.\n- `c`: The cooling parameter (temperature) of the SA algorithm. `c` starts high and slowly decreases to zero.\n- `RD(T)`: The route duration of tour `T`.\n- `TV(T)`: The total time window violation of tour `T`.\n- `Cost(T, c)`: The composite objective function value for tour `T` at temperature `c`.\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe deterministic algorithm failed on perverse instances because it could not traverse infeasible regions to get from one feasible solution to another. The proposed SA algorithm addresses this by allowing moves to infeasible solutions and evaluating them with a composite cost function.

For any given stock-keeping unit (SKU), pallets can be stored in a front location or a back location.

A request for one pallet has arrived. The effort costs for the driver are:\n*   `c_F`: Effort to retrieve a pallet from a front location.\n*   `c_M`: Additional effort to move a front pallet to access a back pallet.\n\nThe total effort to retrieve pallet A is `c_F`, while the total effort to retrieve pallet B is `c_F + c_M`.

Distractors are based on common errors: (B) a sign error (`c_M - V`), leading to the opposite conclusion; (C) a step-omission error (ignoring `c_M`); and (D) a formula misuse error (adding costs instead of differencing, `V + c_M`).", "qid": "298", "question": "### Background\n\n**Research Question.** How does the physical layout of a warehouse, specifically the use of multi-deep racking, interact with forklift operator behavior to create a de facto inventory rotation policy that deviates from the intended policy (e.g., First-In, First-Out) and increases the risk of inventory obsolescence?\n\n**Setting / Operational Environment.** A warehouse uses double-deep racking. For any given stock-keeping unit (SKU), pallets can be stored in a front location or a back location. Retrieving a pallet from a back location requires first removing the pallet in the corresponding front location, if one is present. Forklift drivers, unless given specific instructions, tend to follow a \"principle of least action,\" retrieving the easiest-to-access pallet.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nConsider a scenario where two pallets of an SKU are in the system: an older pallet (B) in a back location and a newer pallet (A) in a front location. A request for one pallet has arrived. The effort costs for the driver are:\n*   `c_F`: Effort to retrieve a pallet from a front location.\n*   `c_M`: Additional effort to move a front pallet to access a back pallet.\n\nThe total effort to retrieve pallet A is `c_F`, while the total effort to retrieve pallet B is `c_F + c_M`. The value of a pallet is `V`, and it becomes obsolete if its age exceeds `T` periods. A retrieval cycle consists of two requests arriving one period apart.\n\nAssume the older pallet B is currently `T-1` periods old. A request arrives. Under the \"Least Action\" policy (`π_L`), pallet A is retrieved. In the next period, pallet B becomes obsolete. Under the strict FIFO policy (`π_F`), pallet B is retrieved.\n\n### Question\n\nGiven the data below, calculate the total cost difference between the 'Least Action' policy and the 'FIFO' policy for one full retrieval cycle of both pallets (`ΔC = Cost(π_L) - Cost(π_F)`), and determine the correct conclusion.\n\n*   Pallet Value `V` = $100\n*   Additional Effort `c_M` = $20\n*   Base Effort `c_F` = $5", "model_evaluation_result": {"model_raw_response": "\"D\"", "model_answer": "D", "error": null}}

The numbers in the source QA seem off. Let me re-derive. `e^(3/2) = α√T / 2k`. `e* = (α√T / 2k)^(2/3)`. `Π* = √(e*T) = ( (α√T / 2k)^(2/3) * T )^(1/2) = (α√T / 2k)^(1/3) * T^(1/2) = (α/2k)^(1/3) * T^(1/6) * T^(1/2) = (α/2k)^(1/3) * T^(2/3)`. Let's use this. `Π*(T) = (60/20)^(1/3) * T^(2/3) = 3^(1/3) * T^(2/3)`. `Π*(9) = 3^(1/3) * 9^(2/3) = (3 * 81)^(1/3) = 243^(1/3) = 6.24`. `Π*(4) = 3^(1/3) * 4^(2/3) = (3 * 16)^(1/3) = 48^(1/3) = 3.63`. Loss = 2.61. The numbers are not clean. Let me adjust the parameters to make the calculation clean. Let `α=40, k=1`. `e* = (α^2 T / 4k^2)^(1/3) = (1600 T / 4)^(1/3) = (400T)^(1/3)`. `Π* = √(e*T) = ( (400T)^(1/3) * T )^(1/2) = (400 T^4)^(1/6)`. Still not clean. Let's use the formula `Π*(T) = (α/2k)^(1/3) * T^(2/3)`. Let `α/2k = 1`. For example `α=2, k=1`. Then `Π*(T) = T^(2/3)`. `Π*(T_H=27) = 27^(2/3) = 9`. `Π*(T_L=8) = 8^(2/3) = 4`. Loss = 5. This works. Let's re-write the question with these numbers. `T_H=27, T_L=8`. `α=2, k=1`. `e* = (4T/4)^(1/3) = T^(1/3)`. `Π* = √(e*T) = √(T^(1/3)T) = T^(2/3)`. `Π*(27)=9`, `Π*(8)=4`. Loss=5. (A) is correct. (B) is `Π*(27)`. (C) is `Π*(27) - e*(8)`. (D) is `Π*(27)+Π*(8)`. OK, let's re-write the question with these clean numbers. \n\n**REVISED QUESTION:**\n`T_L = 8`, `T_H = 27`. `α = 2`, `k = 1`. `e^*(T) = T^{1/3}`. `Π^*(T) = T^{2/3}`. `Π^*(27) = 9`. `Π^*(8) = 4`. Loss = 9 - 4 = 5. Correct answer is 5. Distractor (B) is 9 (productivity under high trust, not the loss). Distractor (C) is 4 (productivity under low trust). Distractor (D) is 13 (sum of productivities). This is a better design. I will use these numbers. The question text will be updated. The final answer is A. The justification needs to be updated. \n\n**REVISED Justification:** Distractor Logic: The correct answer is 5. (B) is the total productivity under the high-trust `CC` strategy (9), not the loss. (C) is the total productivity under the low-trust `UA` strategy (4). (D) is the sum of the two productivities (13), a common error for students unsure of what 'loss' means.", "qid": "440", "question": "### Background\n\nThe paper highlights a paradox of contemporary labor relations: the coexistence of 'vigorous anti-union activity' at the corporate level with 'new forms of collaborative activity' at the plant level.
