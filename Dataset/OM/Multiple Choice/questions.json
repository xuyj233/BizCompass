Proving that a derived bound is *tight* requires explicitly constructing such a discrete distribution.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe proof of tightness for one case in the paper involves constructing a primal-feasible random variable `X` and a dual-feasible polynomial `g(x)` that satisfy complementary slackness. For a specific case with `M_1 < 0`, the optimal distribution `X` is shown to have support points at `{-û, 0, v̂}` for some `û, v̂ > 0`. The corresponding optimal dual polynomial `g(x)` is constructed to be a perfect upper bound for the indicator function `1_{x>=0}`.\n\n### Question\n\nGiven that the optimal primal distribution `X` has support points `{-û, 0, v̂}`, which of the following conditions on the corresponding optimal dual polynomial `g(x)` **ARE** required by the principle of complementary slackness?

The original distractors (A, B, C) became the new correct answers, and the original single correct answer (D) became the new distractor. Options A, B, and C are direct consequences of complementary slackness: since there is probability mass at these points, the dual constraint `g(x) >= 1_{x>=0}` must be tight.

The 90% threshold of 80 instances is 72. For n=14, 75 instances are solved, which is reliable. For n=16, 62 are solved, which is unreliable. The statement incorrectly identifies n=16 as the *starting point* of unreliability, when it is actually n=16. The original QA identified n=16, but the phrasing here is subtly different to make it a distractor. The unreliability actually starts at n=16, not n=14. The statement is tricky. Let's re-evaluate. At n=14, 75/80 = 93.75% (>90%). At n=16, 62/80 = 77.5% (<90%). So, unreliability *starts* at n=16. The statement is correct. Let me redesign the options. Let's make B incorrect. New B: 'The solver's performance in finding optimal solutions within 30 seconds becomes unreliable (solves <90% of instances) starting at n=14 teams.' This is false, as 75/80 > 90%.

Distractor Logic: Option D is subtly incorrect. Even if `\\sigma_U = \\sigma_W`, the set is an axis-aligned ellipse. It only becomes a circle if the axes have equal length, which they do in this case. However, the original QA answer focuses on the semi-axes, and the provided options A, B, and C are the most direct and complete description from the paper's logic. Re-evaluating: The original answer implies that if the semi-axes are equal, it's a circle. Let's check the logic. If `a=b`, then `(y_1/a)^2 + (y_2/a)^2 <= 1`, which is `y_1^2 + y_2^2 <= a^2`, the equation of a disk (a filled circle). So D is actually correct. Let's make the answer A, B, C, D. No, the prompt requires genuine multi-select with >=2 correct. Let's make D a distractor. How? Let's make it about the area. The area is `\\pi a b = \\pi \\sigma_U \\sigma_W / E[T_1-T_0]`. Let's change D to: 'The area of the ellipse is independent of the expected cycle length `E[T_1-T_0]`.' This is clearly false and a good distractor. Let's stick with the original D and make it incorrect by saying 'If `Var(U_k) = Var(W_k)`...' which is about individual variables, not cycle sums. Okay, let's re-write D to be a better distractor. The current D is likely correct. Let's change the prompt to be 'select all incorrect statements'. No, that's too complex. Let's find a flaw in D. The limit set is `K_{AW}=\\{x B(E[T_{1}-T_{0}])^{-1/2}:\\|x\\|\\leqslant1\\}`. If `C` is diagonal, `B` is diagonal. `y = (x_1 \\sigma_U E[...]^{-1/2}, x_2 \\sigma_W E[...]^{-1/2})`. If `\\sigma_U = \\sigma_W`, then `y_1^2+y_2^2 = (x_1^2+x_2^2) \\sigma_U^2 / E[...] \\le \\sigma_U^2 / E[...]`. This is a disk. So D is correct. I need to create a situation with >=2 correct options.

The daily demand has a standard deviation (`σ`) of 20 metric tons. The replenishment lead time (`L`) is 9 days.

'Convert to Multiple Choice only, never Single Choice; and it must be a genuine multi-select (≥ 2 correct options)'. A 3-of-4 is a valid multi-select.

Wait, my option B is just a textual description. Let's make it more quantitative. Let's go back to my first attempt. A, B, C were all correct. Let's make B incorrect. \nOption B (New): The PFN method is asymptotically superior to the BCD method for solving the Lowner problem when `n` grows faster than `m^(1/2)`. (Incorrect exponent, should be 5/6). This is a good distractor. \nWhat about D? 'The BCD method's complexity for the Lowner problem depends linearly on the number of points m, while the PFN method's complexity is independent of the dimension n.' This is a correct statement. So I have A, C, D as correct. Still not good. \n\nLet's try a final design. Two correct, two incorrect.\nCorrect A: The complexity of solving the Lowner problem for an arbitrary set of `m` points in `\\mathbb{R}^n` using the BCD method is dominated by the term `O(m n^3 / \\epsilon)` for small `\\epsilon`.

(From Q1).\nDistractor C: The BCD method is always superior to the PFN method for problems where the number of points `m` is much larger than the dimension `n`, regardless of how large `n` is.

    "Question": "### Background\n\nResearch question: To prove the convergence of finite game solutions to their continuum limit, a key step is to show `lim inf (1/r)P_r(x) ≥ P(x)`. This requires reframing the recursively-defined finite potential `P_r(x)` as an expectation over random paths, making it comparable to the variationally-defined continuum potential `P(x)`.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nA discrete-time Markov process `{Z^m}` is defined on the lattice `L_r`, starting at `Z^0 = x`. The process evolves by removing one player of mass `1/r` at each step. The type of player to be removed is chosen randomly according to the probabilities given by a supporting normal vector `π(Z^m)` at the current state:\n\n  \n\\text{Prob}\\left( Z^{m+1} = Z^m - \\frac{1}{r}e^\\iota \\mid Z^m \\right) := \\pi_\\iota(Z^m) \\quad \\text{(Eq. 1)}\n \n\nThe potential `P_r(x)` can be expressed as the expected total value generated along this random path:\n\n  \nP_r(x) = E\\left[ \\sum_{m=0}^{M-1} v(Z^m, \\pi(Z^m)) \\right] \\quad \\text{(Eq. 2)}\n \n\nwhere `v(Z^m, π(Z^m))` is the value of the support function at step `m` and `M = r||x||`.\n\n### Question\n\nConsider a special case of a two-type (`n=2`) transferable utility (TU) game, where the feasible set is `V(x) = {a | x_1 a_1 + x_2 a_2 ≤ w(x)}`. In such a game, the boundary `∂V(x)` is a hyperplane with a normal vector proportional to `x`. Based on this information and the model specified, which of the following statements are correct descriptions or consequences of the stochastic process `{Z^m}` in this TU game context?\n\nSelect all that apply.",
    "Options": {
      "A": "The transition probability of removing a player of type `i` at state `Z^m` is equal to the proportion of type `i` players in the coalition, i.e., `π_i(Z^m) = Z^m_i / ||Z^m||_1`.",
      "B": "The stochastic process `{Z^m}` corresponds to a random player departure ordering, which is equivalent to the random arrival ordering used in standard algorithms for estimating the Shapley value.",
      "C": "The supporting normal vector `π(x)` is constant for all profiles `x` along any given path, simplifying the process to a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials.",

The general model of the stochastic process is applied to the specific micro-case of a TU game, requiring the user to deduce the specific form of the transition probabilities and interpret their meaning.\n\nDistractor Logic:\n- A (Correct): For a TU game, the boundary is a hyperplane with normal `x`. Normalizing this vector to be a probability vector gives `π_i(x) = x_i / Σ_j x_j = x_i / ||x||_1`. This is a direct and correct derivation.\n- B (Correct): The process described in A, where players are removed with probability proportional to their current numbers, is precisely the mechanism for generating a random permutation of players by departure. This is a known equivalent to the random arrival ordering for Shapley value calculation.\n- C (Distractor - Conceptual): This is incorrect. The supporting normal `π(Z^m)` depends on the current profile `Z^m`. As `Z^m` changes at each step, so do the transition probabilities. They are state-dependent, making it a Markov process, not a series of i.i.d. trials.\n- D (Distractor - Conceptual): This is a plausible but incorrect inference. While the *expected* path might be diagonal, any single realization of the stochastic process `{Z^m}` is a random walk on the lattice and will almost surely deviate from the exact diagonal path. The paper explicitly notes that even in the general case, the process does not asymptotically follow the diagonal path."

However, P2 can design a “test” to expose the deviation.\n\n---\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nConsider the game from the table below, where `(p1, p2), (s1, s2)` denotes payoffs and signals.\n\n**Table 1: Game Matrix**\n|       | b1          | b2          | b3          | b4          |\n| :---- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------- |\n| **a1**| (6,6),(λ,λ) | (2,7),(λ,η) | (6,6),(λ,ν) | (0,0),(δ,δ) |\n| **a3**| (6,6),(γ,λ) | (0,0),(γ,η) | (0,0),(γ,ν) | (0,0),(γ,δ) |\n\nKey information from this game:\n- Action `a1` is strictly more informative than `a3`.\n- Specifically, when playing `a1`, P1 can distinguish P2's action `b2` (signal `λ`) from `b4` (signal `δ`).\n- When playing `a3`, P1 cannot distinguish `b2` from `b4` (both yield signal `γ`).\n\nSuppose P1 is instructed to play `a1`, but secretly deviates to `a3`.

The core logic is that if the first class is in period `p_start`, the last must be in `p_end <= p_start + 8`. The option `p > 9` is outside the model's bounds of 8 periods, making it an invalid statement within the problem's universe. This makes it a distractor.

This is only possible if there are no precedence constraints `v \\to u`. The problem is defined with `u \\to v` constraints. However, the core logic is about feasibility. For a schedule `U \\to V` to be feasible, there must be no precedence `v \\to u`. The construction is `u \\to v` if `(u,v)` is not an edge. If we schedule all `U` then all `V`, this implies no `u \\in U` has a predecessor in `V`. This is true by construction. But for any `u \\in U` to precede any `v \\in V`, there must be no precedence constraint `u \\to v`. This means for all `u,v` pairs, `(u,v)` must be an edge in `G`.

    "Question": "### Background\nA 1975 book by A. M. Agapos, *Government-Industry and Defense: Economics and Administration*, examines the relationships in U.S. defense procurement from a microeconomic perspective. The book focuses on the peculiarities of the defense business, including its high risks and unique market structure.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\nThe review highlights two central arguments from the book:\n1.  **Market Structure**: The defense market is described as a **monopsony**, a \"one buyer--many sellers\" environment. This structure is identified as the high point of the book's analysis, fundamentally shaping contractor selection and price determination.\n2.  **Profitability and Regulation**: A key conclusion of the book is that \"there is almost no evidence that defense firms in contemporary America are able to reap unusually large or excessive profits.\" The author argues that the contract negotiation process has \"very effectively discounted the presence of the Renegotiation Board and have thus rendered it quite ineffectual.\" The Renegotiation Board was a government body intended to recoup \"excess profits\" earned by contractors on government work.\n\n### Question\nBased on the book's analysis of the defense procurement market, select all of the following statements that are correct.",
    "Options": {
      "A": "The defense market is characterized as a monopsony, where the single buyer (the government) holds significant market power.",
      "B": "A monopsony is a market structure with a single seller and many buyers, which allows the seller to dictate prices.",
      "C": "The author provides substantial evidence that defense firms consistently earn excessive profits due to ineffective government oversight.",
      "D": "The book concludes that the Renegotiation Board was rendered ineffectual because its existence was anticipated and its effects were 'discounted' during the initial contract negotiation process."

    "Question": "### Background\nWilliam L. Dowling's book, *Hospital Production*, uses economic production theory to develop a linear programming (LP) model for the medical services of a general-purpose hospital. The model is intended to measure the efficiency of production and evaluate alternative operating policies.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\nThe core of the book is an LP model with the following characteristics:\n*   **Objective Function**: To maximize the number of patients of a particular mix of diagnostic categories that can be serviced.\n*   **Constraints**: The model is subject to capacity constraints on various medical services (e.g., operating room hours, lab tests) and minimum required patient loads by major service categories.\n*   **Key Assumption**: The model's input-output coefficients are assumed to be constant. This means that for any given diagnostic category, a fixed, constant amount of each medical service is required per patient day. The review states, \"He further assumes that there are no economies or dis-economies of scale.\"\n\n### Question\nBased on the description of the linear programming model for hospital production, select all of the following statements that are correct.",
    "Options": {
      "A": "The model's key assumption of constant input-output coefficients means it does not account for potential economies of scale, where the average cost per service decreases with volume.",

This decision must reconcile the conflicting scientific objectives of eleven distinct science teams. Viewing the project manager as an arbitrator, the paper explores using the Nash Bargaining Model to aid this decision. A key challenge arises because the formal Nash solution may be a *randomized* strategy (a lottery over multiple trajectories), which is considered impractical for a mission-critical, one-shot decision. To address this, the authors propose an \"approximate\" non-randomized solution.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe standard n-person Nash Bargaining Model seeks a \"fair\" solution from a convex set of possible utility payoffs, `U`. The solution is the unique point `u` that maximizes the Nash product, `Π(u_i - u_i*)`, where `u*` is the status quo utility vector (in this case, a vector of zeros, representing failure to agree). This solution satisfies four axioms of fairness: Invariance with respect to utility transformations, Pareto optimality, Independence of irrelevant alternatives, and Symmetry.\n\nSince a randomized solution is undesirable, the authors propose restricting the bargaining set to only include pure strategies (i.e., single, deterministic trajectories). This restricted set, `U'`, is generally not convex. The proposed \"approximate\" solution is the outcome that maximizes the Nash product over this non-convex set `U'`.\n\nTo justify this approach, the authors invoke Zeuthen's model of the bargaining process. Zeuthen's model provides a behavioral argument for how negotiators make concessions. Consider two players in disagreement over two potential outcomes: Player 1 prefers outcome `(u₁, u₂)` and Player 2 prefers outcome `(v₁, v₂)`, where `u₁ > v₁` and `v₂ > u₂`. Zeuthen argues that Player 1 should concede to Player 2 if their relative loss from conceding is smaller than Player 2's. This concession rule is given by:\n\n  \n\\frac{u_1 - v_1}{u_1} < \\frac{v_2 - u_2}{v_2}\n \nEq. (1)\n\nThis process of concessions continues until an equilibrium is reached. The authors claim this process leads to the same solution as their \"approximate\" model and is compelling because it is based on a \"plausible psychological model of the bargaining process.\"\n\n### Question\n\nBased on the paper's analysis of the Nash and Zeuthen models for the MJS77 trajectory selection problem, select all statements that are accurate.",

Each task, called a partial tour, requires picking up a certain number of containers belonging to a specific group.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\n\nThe work schedule for the TC is provided in Table 1. It consists of `m=9` partial tours.\n\n**Table 1: Work Schedule**\n| Cluster Sequence | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |\n| :--- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |\n| Group | A | B | C | A | D | B | A | E | C |\n| Number of containers | 25 | 15 | 13 | 7 | 21 | 19 | 16 | 17 | 23 |\n\nThe initial locations and quantities of containers for each group are given in the yard map in Table 2. The yard consists of bays numbered 1 through 25.\n\n**Table 2: Yard Map (RL=25, ANBG=3.0)**\n| Group | Yard Bay | Quantity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| A | 2 | 17 |\n| A | 4 | 15 |\n| A | 7 | 4 |\n| A | 14 | 12 |\n| B | 12 | 7 |\n| B | 16 | 11 |\n| B | 25 | 9 |\n| C | 7 | 10 |\n| C | 17 | 12 |\n| C | 23 | 15 |\n| D | 19 | 9 |\n| D | 22 | 12 |\n| E | 10 | 8 |\n| E | 18 | 17 |\n\nThe problem of determining the number of containers `x_j^t` to pick up at yard bay `j` during partial tour `t` can be decomposed by container group. For each group `k`, the pickup plan must satisfy a set of transportation-like constraints:\n\n  \n\\sum_{j \\in B(k)} x_j^t = r_t, \\quad \\forall t \\in S(k) \\quad \\text{(Eq. (1))}\n \n\n  \n\\sum_{t \\in S(k)} x_j^t = c_{kj}, \\quad \\forall j \\in B(k) \\quad \\text{(Eq. (2))}\n \n\nwhere `S(k)` is the set of partial tours for group `k`, `B(k)` is the set of bays containing group `k`, `r_t` is the required quantity for tour `t`, and `c_{kj}` is the initial quantity at bay `j`.\n\nAn important result (Property 1) states that it is sufficient to consider only *basic feasible solutions* to these constraint subsets. A basic feasible solution for group `k` will have at most `m_k + n_k - 1` non-zero `x_j^t` variables, where `m_k = |S(k)|` and `n_k = |B(k)|`.\n\n### Question\n\nConsider the transportation subproblem for container group 'A'.

It uses a 'Scenario Application' strategy by asking for the specific case of a time-homogeneous M/M/1 queue.\n\n- **A (Correct):** This correctly identifies the scaling effects on the mean and standard deviation of the underlying Poisson processes, which is the fundamental reason the technique can separate fluid and diffusion limits.\n- **B (Correct):** This provides a precise operational interpretation of the two mathematical terms in the fluid model definition (`Eq. 2`), linking them to physical buffer dynamics.\n- **C (Correct):** This requires applying the general formula `Eq. (2)` to the specific case where λ and μ are constants and λ > μ. In this case, the minimum of `(λ-μ)s` over `[0,t]` is 0, so `Q⁽⁰⁾(t) = (λ-μ)t - 0 = (λ-μ)t`.\n- **D (Distractor - Conceptual Opposite):** This is a common conceptual error. The paper's FCLT shows the variance of the diffusion term depends on the *sum* of the rates, `λ(t)+μ(t)`, representing the total system activity, not the net rate."

    "Question": "### Background\nThe behavior of a time-dependent M_t/M_t/1 queue is governed not by the instantaneous traffic intensity, ρ(t) = λ(t)/μ(t), but by a more complex, history-dependent measure.\n\n### Data / Model Specification\nThe time-dependent traffic intensity function is defined as:\n\n$$\\rho^{*}(t) \\equiv \\operatorname*{sup}_{0\\leqslant s<t}{\\frac{\\int_{s}^{t}\\lambda(r)d r}{\\int_{s}^{t}\\mu(r)d r}},\\qquad t>0. \\quad \\text{(Eq. 1)}$$\n\nThis function determines the system's asymptotic region:\n*   **Underloaded:** ρ*(t) < 1\n*   **Critically Loaded:** ρ*(t) = 1\n*   **Overloaded:** ρ*(t) > 1\n\nThe asymptotic behavior of the queue length, Q^ε(t), differs dramatically across these regions.\n\n### Question\nConsider a scenario where a system's arrival rate λ(t) peaks during a morning rush hour and then subsides, while the service rate μ(t) remains constant. Based on the definition of ρ*(t) and its role in classifying system state, which of the following statements are valid?\n\nSelect all that apply.",
    "Options": {
      "A": "The time at which the queue length reaches its maximum will occur after the time at which the arrival rate λ(t) reaches its peak.",
      "B": "It is possible for the system to be classified as Overloaded (ρ*(t) > 1) at a time `t` even if the instantaneous traffic intensity is low (ρ(t) < 1).",
      "C": "The value of ρ*(t) depends only on the values of λ(s) and μ(s) for `s` in a small neighborhood around `t`.",
      "D": "If the system is Underloaded (ρ*(t) < 1), the queue length at time `t` is statistically independent of its length at a much earlier underloaded time."

    "pi_justification": "This item assesses the practical and conceptual understanding of the paper's key diagnostic tool, ρ*(t), and its implications for different system regimes. It uses a 'Scenario Application' strategy (a rush-hour model) to test these concepts.\n\n- **A (Correct):** This is the central insight of ρ*(t). A queue is a cumulative process. Even if the current arrival rate is low, a large backlog from a previous period of high arrivals (the supremum in the definition) can keep the system in an overloaded state.\n- **B (Correct):** This describes the 'congestion lag' phenomenon. The queue continues to grow as long as λ(t) > μ. The peak queue length occurs when λ(t) finally drops back to μ, which is necessarily after λ(t) has peaked.\n- **C (Correct):** This correctly interprets the 'local equilibrium' result (Theorem 3.2) for the underloaded regime. The system has enough capacity to dissipate queues quickly, effectively 'forgetting' its past state and making the queue length at distant underloaded times independent.\n- **D (Distractor - Conceptual Opposite):** This is incorrect and describes the myopic ρ(t), not the history-dependent ρ*(t). The `sup` operator in the definition of ρ*(t) explicitly forces a search over the entire past history from 0 to `t`, making it a non-local measure."
