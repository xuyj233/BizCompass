when a borrower becomes 60 days past due , we terminate borrowing privileges , and those privileges are not subsequently reinstated . at that point , we continue our collection/recovery processes , which may include a loss mitigation loan modification resulting in a loan that is classified as a tdr . see note 5 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information . loan modifications and troubled debt restructurings consumer loan modifications we modify loans under government and pnc-developed programs based upon our commitment to help eligible homeowners and borrowers avoid foreclosure , where appropriate . initially , a borrower is evaluated for a modification under a government program . if a borrower does not qualify under a government program , the borrower is then evaluated under a pnc program . our programs utilize both temporary and permanent modifications and typically reduce the interest rate , extend the term and/or defer principal . temporary and permanent modifications under programs involving a change to loan terms are generally classified as tdrs . further , certain payment plans and trial payment arrangements which do not include a contractual change to loan terms may be classified as tdrs . additional detail on tdrs is discussed below as well as in note 5 asset quality in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . a temporary modification , with a term between three and 60 months , involves a change in original loan terms for a period of time and reverts to a calculated exit rate for the remaining term of the loan as of a specific date . a permanent modification , with a term greater than 60 months , is a modification in which the terms of the original loan are changed . permanent modifications primarily include the government-created home affordable modification program ( hamp ) or pnc-developed hamp-like modification programs . for consumer loan programs , such as residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines , we will enter into a temporary modification when the borrower has indicated a temporary hardship and a willingness to bring current the delinquent loan balance . examples of this situation often include delinquency due to illness or death in the family , or a loss of employment . permanent modifications are entered into when it is confirmed that the borrower does not possess the income necessary to continue making loan payments at the current amount , but our expectation is that payments at lower amounts can be made . residential mortgage and home equity loans and lines have been modified with changes in terms for up to 60 months , although the majority involve periods of three to 24 months . we also monitor the success rates and delinquency status of our loan modification programs to assess their effectiveness in serving our customers 2019 needs while mitigating credit losses . the following tables provide the number of accounts and unpaid principal balance of modified consumer real estate related loans as well as the number of accounts and unpaid principal

secondary market trading activities where positions are bought and sold to make profits from short-term movements in price . loans held for trading purposes are included in trading assets and are carried at fair value , with the gains and losses included in trading revenue . interest income is recognized using the interest method , or on a basis approximating a level rate of return over the term of the loan . nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest is discontinued . loans ( other than certain consumer loans discussed below ) are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if , in the opinion of management , full payment of principal or interest is in doubt , or when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due and collateral , if any , is insufficient to cover prin- cipal and interest . interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed against interest income . in addition , the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended . interest income on nonaccrual loans is recognized only to the extent it is received in cash . however , where there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of loan principal , all cash thereafter received is applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan . loans are restored to accrual status only when interest and principal payments are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured . consumer loans are generally charged to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency , in accor- dance with the federal financial institutions examination council ( 201cffiec 201d ) policy . for example , credit card loans are charged off at the earlier of 180 days past due or within 60 days from receiving notification

portfolio was secured by second liens where we do not hold the first lien position . the credit performance of the majority of the home equity portfolio where we are in , hold or service the first lien position , is superior to the portion of the portfolio where we hold the second lien position but do not hold the first lien . lien position information is generally based upon original ltv at the time of origination . however , after origination pnc is not typically notified when a senior lien position that is not held by pnc is satisfied . therefore , information about the current lien status of junior lien loans is less readily available in cases where pnc does not also hold the senior lien . additionally , pnc is not typically notified when a junior lien position is added after origination of a pnc first lien . this updated information for both junior and senior liens must be obtained from external sources , and therefore , pnc has contracted with an industry-leading third-party service provider to obtain updated loan , lien and collateral data that is aggregated from public and private sources . we track borrower performance monthly , including obtaining original ltvs , updated fico scores at least quarterly , updated ltvs semi-annually , and other credit metrics at least quarterly , including the historical performance of any mortgage loans regardless of lien position that we do or do not hold . this information is used for internal reporting and risk management . for internal reporting and risk management we also segment the population into pools based on product type ( e.g. , home equity loans , brokered home equity loans , home equity lines of credit , brokered home equity lines of credit ) . as part of our overall risk analysis and monitoring , we segment the home equity portfolio based upon the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of these loans , as well as the delinquency , modification status and bankruptcy status of any mortgage loan with the same borrower ( regardless of whether it is a first lien senior to our second lien ) . in establishing our alll for non-impaired loans , we primarily utilize a delinquency roll-rate methodology for pools of loans . in accordance with accounting principles , under this methodology , we establish our allowance based upon incurred losses , not lifetime expected losses . the roll-rate methodology estimates transition/roll of loan balances from one delinquency state ( e.g. , 30-59 days past due ) to another delinquency state ( e.g. , 60-89 days past due ) and ultimately to charge-off . the roll through to charge-off is based on pnc 2019s actual loss experience for each type of pool . each of our home equity pools contains both first and second liens . our experience has been that the ratio of first to second lien loans has been consistent over time and the charge-off amounts for the pools , used to establish our allowance , include losses on both first and second liens loans . generally , our variable-rate home equity lines of credit have either a seven or ten year draw period , followed by a 20-year amortization term . during the draw period , we have home equity lines of credit where borrowers pay either interest or principal and interest . we view home equity lines of credit where borrowers are paying principal and interest under the draw period as less risky than those where the borrowers are paying interest only , as these borrowers have a demonstrated ability to make some level of principal and interest payments . the risk associated with the borrower 2019s ability to satisfy the loan terms upon the draw period ending is considered in establishing our alll . based upon outstanding balances at december 31 , 2014 , the

    "Context": "the company has elected the fair-value option where the interest-rate risk of such liabilities is economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings . the election has been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications . these positions are reported in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet . the majority of these non-structured liabilities are a result of the company 2019s election of the fair-value option for liabilities associated with the citi-advised structured investment vehicles ( sivs ) , which were consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2007 . the change in fair values of the sivs 2019 liabilities reported in earnings was $ 2.6 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2008 . for these non-structured liabilities the aggregate fair value is $ 263 million lower than the aggregate unpaid principal balance as of december 31 , 2008 . for all other non-structured liabilities classified as long-term debt for which the fair-value option has been elected , the aggregate unpaid principal balance exceeds the aggregate fair value of such instruments by $ 97 million as of december 31 , 2008 while the aggregate fair value exceeded the aggregate unpaid principal by $ 112 million as of december 31 , 2007 . the change in fair value of these non-structured liabilities reported a gain of $ 1.2 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2008 . the change in fair value for these non-structured liabilities is reported in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . related interest expense continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . certain mortgage loans citigroup has elected the fair-value option for certain purchased and originated prime fixed-rate and conforming adjustable-rate first mortgage loans held-for- sale . these loans are intended for sale or securitization and are hedged with derivative instruments . the company has elected the fair-value option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications . the fair-value option was not elected for loans held-for-investment , as those loans are not hedged with derivative instruments . this election was effective for applicable instruments originated or purchased on or after september 1 , 2007 . the following table provides information about certain mortgage loans carried at fair value : in millions of dollars december 31 , december 31 , carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet $ 4273 $ 6392 aggregate fair value in excess of unpaid principal balance $ 138 $ 136 balance on non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due $ 9 $ 17 aggregate unpaid principal balance in excess of fair value for non-accrual loans or loans more than 90 days past due $ 2 $ 2014 the changes in fair values of these mortgage loans is reported in other revenue in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . the changes in fair value during the year ended december 31 , 2008 due to instrument- specific credit risk resulted in a $ 32 million loss . the change in fair value during 2007 due to instrument-specific credit risk was immaterial . related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . items selected for fair-value accounting in accordance with sfas 155 and sfas 156 certain hybrid financial instruments the company has elected to apply fair-value accounting under sfas 155 for certain hybrid financial assets and liabilities whose performance is linked to risks other than interest rate , foreign exchange or inflation ( e.g. , equity , credit or commodity risks ) . in addition , the company has elected fair-value accounting under sfas 155 for residual interests retained from securitizing certain financial assets . the company has elected fair-value accounting for these instruments because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair-value basis . in addition , the accounting for these instruments is simplified under a fair-value approach as it eliminates the complicated operational requirements of bifurcating the embedded derivatives from the host contracts and accounting for each separately . the hybrid financial instruments are classified as trading account assets , loans , deposits , trading account liabilities ( for prepaid derivatives ) , short-term borrowings or long-term debt on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form , while residual interests in certain securitizations are classified as trading account assets . for hybrid financial instruments for which fair-value accounting has been elected under sfas 155 and that are classified as long-term debt , the aggregate unpaid principal exceeds the aggregate fair value by $ 1.9 billion as of december 31 , 2008 , while the aggregate fair value exceeds the aggregate unpaid principal balance by $ 460 million as of december 31 , 2007 . the difference for those instruments classified as loans is immaterial . changes in fair value for hybrid financial instruments , which in most cases includes a component for accrued interest , are recorded in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . interest accruals for certain hybrid instruments classified as trading assets are recorded separately from the change in fair value as interest revenue in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . mortgage servicing rights the company accounts for mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value in accordance with sfas 156 . fair value for msrs is determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach . this approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows

elected the fair-value option where the interest-rate risk of such liabilities is economically hedged with derivative contracts or the proceeds are used to purchase financial assets that will also be accounted for at fair value through earnings . the election has been made to mitigate accounting mismatches and to achieve operational simplifications . these positions are reported in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet . the majority of these non-structured liabilities are a result of the company 2019s election of the fair-value option for liabilities associated with the citi-advised structured investment vehicles ( sivs ) , which were consolidated during the fourth quarter of 2007 . the change in fair values of the sivs 2019 liabilities reported in earnings was $ 2.6 billion for the year ended december 31 , 2008 . for these non-structured liabilities the aggregate fair value is $ 263 million lower than the aggregate

option to mitigate accounting mismatches in cases where hedge accounting is complex and to achieve operational simplifications . the fair-value option was not elected for loans held-for-investment , as those loans are not hedged with derivative instruments . this election was effective for applicable instruments originated or purchased on or after september 1 , 2007 . the following table provides information about certain mortgage loans carried at fair value : in millions of dollars december 31 , december 31 , carrying amount reported on the consolidated balance sheet $ 4273 $ 6392 aggregate

the changes in fair value during the year ended december 31 , 2008 due to instrument- specific credit risk resulted in a $ 32 million loss . the change in fair value during 2007 due to instrument-specific credit risk was immaterial . related interest income continues to be measured based on the contractual interest rates and reported as such in the consolidated income statement . items selected for fair-value accounting in accordance with sfas 155 and sfas 156 certain hybrid financial instruments the company has elected to apply fair-value accounting under sfas 155 for certain hybrid financial assets and liabilities whose performance is linked to risks other than interest rate , foreign exchange or inflation ( e.g. , equity , credit or commodity risks ) . in addition , the company has elected fair-value accounting under sfas 155 for residual interests retained from securitizing certain financial assets . the company has elected fair-value accounting for these instruments because these exposures are considered to be trading-related positions and , therefore , are managed on a fair-value basis . in addition , the accounting for these instruments is simplified under a fair-value approach as it eliminates the complicated operational requirements of bifurcating the embedded derivatives from the host contracts and accounting for each separately . the hybrid financial instruments are classified as trading account assets , loans , deposits , trading account liabilities ( for prepaid derivatives ) , short-term borrowings or long-term debt on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet according to their legal form , while residual interests in certain securitizations are classified as trading account assets . for hybrid financial instruments for which fair-value accounting has been elected under sfas 155 and that are classified as long-term debt , the aggregate unpaid principal exceeds the aggregate fair value by $ 1.9 billion as of december 31 , 2008 , while the aggregate fair value exceeds the aggregate unpaid principal balance by $ 460 million as of december 31 , 2007 . the difference for those instruments classified as loans is immaterial . changes in fair value for hybrid financial instruments , which in most cases includes a component for accrued interest , are recorded in principal transactions in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . interest accruals for certain hybrid instruments classified as trading assets are recorded separately from the change in fair value as interest revenue in the company 2019s consolidated statement of income . mortgage servicing rights the company accounts for mortgage servicing rights ( msrs ) at fair value in accordance with sfas 156 . fair value for msrs is determined using an option-adjusted spread valuation approach . this approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest-rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted rates . the model assumptions used in the valuation of msrs include mortgage prepayment speeds and discount rates . the fair value of msrs is primarily affected by changes in prepayments that result from shifts in mortgage interest rates . in managing this risk , the company hedges a significant portion of the values of its msrs through the use of interest-rate derivative contracts , forward- purchase commitments of mortgage-backed securities , and purchased securities classified as trading . see note 23 on page 175 for further discussions regarding the accounting and reporting of msrs . these msrs , which totaled $ 5.7 billion and $ 8.4 billion as of december 31 , 2008 and december 31 , 2007 , respectively , are classified as mortgage servicing rights on citigroup

, audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements and future events that would impact our previously recorded unrecognized tax benefits and the range of anticipated increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits are subject to significant uncertainty . it is possible that the ultimate outcome of current or future examinations may exceed our provision for current unrecognized tax

of those shares into the novo mercado , which is a listing segment of the brazilian stock exchange with the highest standards of corporate governance . upon conversion of the preferred shares into ordinary shares , aes no longer controlled eletropaulo , but maintained significant influence over the business . as a result , the company deconsolidated eletropaulo . after deconsolidation , the

about 77% ( 77 % ) of the total u.s . projected benefit obligation at december 31 , 2011 . depending upon the affected employee's combined age and years of service to ppg , this change resulted in

    "Context": "management 2019s discussion and analysis 102 jpmorgan chase & co./2016 annual report derivative contracts in the normal course of business , the firm uses derivative instruments predominantly for market-making activities . derivatives enable customers to manage exposures to fluctuations in interest rates , currencies and other markets . the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure . the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed . for otc derivatives the firm is exposed to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty . for exchange- traded derivatives ( 201cetd 201d ) , such as futures and options and 201ccleared 201d over-the-counter ( 201cotc-cleared 201d ) derivatives , the firm is generally exposed to the credit risk of the relevant ccp . where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from derivative transactions through the use of legally enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements . for further discussion of derivative contracts , counterparties and settlement types , see note 6 . the following table summarizes the net derivative receivables for the periods presented . derivative receivables .\n|december 31 ( in millions )|2016|2015|\n|interest rate|$ 28302|$ 26363|\n|credit derivatives|1294|1423|\n|foreign exchange|23271|17177|\n|equity|4939|5529|\n|commodity|6272|9185|\n|total net of cash collateral|64078|59677|\n|liquid securities and other cash collateral held against derivative receivables ( a )|-22705 ( 22705 )|-16580 ( 16580 )|\n|total net of all collateral|$ 41373|$ 43097|\n( a ) includes collateral related to derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 64.1 billion and $ 59.7 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . these amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 22.7 billion and $ 16.6 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . the change in derivative receivables was predominantly related to client-driven market-making activities in cib . the increase in derivative receivables reflected the impact of market movements , which increased foreign exchange receivables , partially offset by reduced commodity derivative receivables . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 6 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 31.1 billion and $ 32.4 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 41.4 billion and $ 43.1 billion at december 31 , 2016 and 2015 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates an adjustment , the cva , to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . the cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the primary components of changes in cva are credit spreads , new deal activity or unwinds , and changes in the underlying market environment . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit .",

carlo 2013based model to estimate the expected losses of each of the conduits and considers the rela- tive rights and obligations of each of the variable interest holders . the variability to be considered in the modeling of expected losses is based on the design of the entity . the firm 2019s traditional multi-seller conduits are designed to pass credit risk , not liquidity risk , to its vari- able interest holders , as the assets are intended to be held in the conduit for the longer term . under fin 46r , the firm is required to run the monte carlo-based expected loss model each time a reconsideration event occurs . in applying this guidance to the conduits , the following events are considered to be reconsideration events as they could affect the determination of the primary beneficiary of the conduits : 2022 new deals , including the issuance of new or additional variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 changes in usage , including the change in the level of outstand- ing variable interests ( credit support , liquidity facilities , etc ) ; 2022 modifications of asset purchase agreements ; and 2022 sales of interests held by the primary beneficiary . from an operational perspective , the firm does not run its monte carlo-based expected loss model every time there is a reconsidera- tion event due to the frequency of their occurrence . instead , the firm runs its expected loss model each quarter and includes a growth assumption for each conduit to ensure that a sufficient amount of elns exists for each conduit at any point during the quarter . as part of its normal quarterly model review , the firm reassesses the underlying assumptions and inputs of the expected loss model . during the second half of 2007 , certain assumptions used in the model were adjusted to reflect the then current market conditions . specifically , risk ratings and loss given default assumptions relating to residential subprime mortgage exposures were modified . for other nonmortgage-related asset classes , the firm determined that the assumptions in the model required little adjustment . as a result of the updates to the model , during the fourth quarter of 2007 the terms of the elns were renegotiated to increase the level of commit- ment and funded amounts to be provided by the eln holders . the total amount of expected loss notes outstanding at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , were $ 130 million and $ 54 million , respectively . management concluded that the model assumptions used were reflective of market participant 2019s assumptions and appropriately considered the probability of a recurrence of recent market events . qualitative considerations the multi-seller conduits are primarily designed to provide an efficient means for clients to access the commercial paper market . the firm believes the conduits effectively disperse risk among all parties and that the preponderance of economic risk in the firm 2019s multi-seller conduits is not held by jpmorgan chase . the percentage of assets in the multi-seller conduits that the firm views as client-related represent 99% ( 99 % ) and 98% ( 98 % ) of the total conduits 2019 holdings at december 31 , 2007 and 2006 , respectively . consolidated sensitivity analysis on capital it is possible that the firm could be required to consolidate a vie if it were determined that the firm became the primary beneficiary of the vie under the provisions of fin 46r . the factors involved in making the determination of whether or not a vie should be consolidated are dis- cussed above and in note 1 on page 108 of this annual report . the table below shows the impact on the firm 2019s reported assets , liabilities , net income , tier 1 capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio if the firm were required to consolidate all of the multi-seller conduits that it administers . as of or for the year ending december 31 , 2007 .\n|( in billions except

structures transactions , typically derivative structures , with these vies to meet investor needs . the firm may also provide liquidity and other support . the risks inherent in the derivative instruments or liq- uidity commitments are managed similarly to other credit , market or liquidity risks to which the firm is exposed . the principal types of vies for which the firm is engaged in these structuring activities are municipal bond vehicles , credit-linked note vehicles and collateralized debt obligation vehicles . municipal bond vehicles the firm has created a series of secondary market trusts that provide short-term investors with qualifying tax-exempt investments , and that allow investors in tax-exempt securities to finance their investments at short-term tax-exempt rates . in a typical transaction , the vehicle pur- chases fixed-rate longer-term highly rated municipal bonds and funds the purchase by issuing two types of securities : ( 1 ) putable floating- rate certificates and ( 2 ) inverse floating-rate residual interests ( 201cresid- ual interests 201d ) . the maturity of each of the putable floating-rate certifi- cates and the residual interests is equal to the life of the vehicle , while the maturity of the underlying municipal bonds is longer . holders of the putable floating-rate certificates may 201cput 201d , or tender , the certifi- cates if the remarketing agent cannot successfully remarket the float- ing-rate certificates to another investor . a liquidity facility conditionally obligates the liquidity provider to fund the purchase of the tendered floating-rate certificates . upon termination of the vehicle , if the pro- ceeds from the sale of the underlying municipal bonds are not suffi- cient to repay the liquidity facility , the liquidity provider has recourse either to excess collateralization in the vehicle or the residual interest holders for reimbursement . the third-party holders of the residual interests in these vehicles could experience losses if the face amount of the putable floating-rate cer- tificates exceeds the market value of the municipal bonds upon termi- nation of the vehicle . certain vehicles require a smaller initial invest- ment by the residual interest holders and thus do not result in excess collateralization . for these vehicles there exists a reimbursement obli- .",

145.5 mil- lion and recognized an impairment charge of $ 319.2 million based on a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model further discussed below . this impair- ment charge was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is reported within impair- ment of pullmantur related assets within our consoli- dated statements of comprehensive income ( loss ) . during the fourth quarter of 2014 , we performed a qualitative assessment of whether it was more-likely- than-not that our royal caribbean international reporting unit 2019s fair value was less than its carrying amount before applying the two-step goodwill impair- ment test . the qualitative analysis included assessing the impact of certain factors such as general economic conditions , limitations on accessing capital , changes in forecasted operating results , changes in fuel prices and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates . based on our qualitative assessment , we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of the royal caribbean international reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and thus , we did not pro- ceed to the two-step goodwill impairment test . no indicators of impairment exist primarily because the reporting unit 2019s fair value has consistently exceeded its carrying value by a significant margin , its financial performance has been solid in the face of mixed economic environments and forecasts of operating results generated by the reporting unit appear suffi- cient to support its carrying value . we also performed our annual impairment review of goodwill for pullmantur 2019s reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2014 . we did not perform a quali- tative assessment but instead proceeded directly to the two-step goodwill impairment test . we estimated the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow model . the principal assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are projected operating results , weighted- average cost of capital , and terminal value . signifi- cantly impacting these assumptions are the transfer of vessels from our other cruise brands to pullmantur . the discounted cash flow model used our 2015 pro- jected operating results as a base . to that base , we added future years 2019 cash flows assuming multiple rev- enue and expense scenarios that reflect the impact of different global economic environments beyond 2015 on pullmantur 2019s reporting unit . we assigned a probability to each revenue and expense scenario . we discounted the projected cash flows using rates specific to pullmantur 2019s reporting unit based on its weighted-average cost of capital . based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows , we deter- mined the fair value of the pullmantur reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 52% ( 52 % ) resulting in no impairment to pullmantur 2019s goodwill . pullmantur is a brand targeted primarily at the spanish , portuguese and latin american markets , with an increasing focus on latin america . the persistent economic instability in these markets has created sig- nificant uncertainties in forecasting operating results and future cash flows used in our impairment analyses . we continue to monitor economic events in these markets for their potential impact on pullmantur 2019s business and valuation . further , the estimation of fair value utilizing discounted expected future cash flows includes numerous uncertainties which require our significant judgment when making assumptions of expected revenues , operating costs , marketing , sell- ing and administrative expenses , interest rates , ship additions and retirements as well as assumptions regarding the cruise vacation industry 2019s competitive environment and general economic and business conditions , among other factors . if there are changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impairment analyses , especially in net yields or if certain transfers of vessels from our other cruise brands to the pullmantur fleet do not take place , it is possible that an impairment charge of pullmantur 2019s reporting unit 2019s goodwill may be required . of these factors , the planned transfers of vessels to the pullmantur fleet is most significant to the projected future cash flows . if the transfers do not occur , we will likely fail step one of the impairment test . note 4 . intangible assets intangible assets are reported in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and consist

commitments or the firm fulfill its obligations under these guarantees , and the clients subsequently fail to perform according to the terms of these contracts . most of these commitments and guarantees are refinanced , extended , cancelled , or expire without being drawn upon or a default occurring . in the firm 2019s view , the total contractual amount of these wholesale lending-related commitments is not representative of the firm 2019s expected future credit exposure or funding requirements . for further information on wholesale lending-related commitments , refer to note 27 . clearing services the firm provides clearing services for clients entering into certain securities and derivative contracts . through the provision of these services the firm is exposed to the risk of non-performance by its clients and may be required to share in losses incurred by ccps . where possible , the firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk to its clients through the collection of adequate margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement . for further discussion of clearing services , refer to note 27 . derivative contracts derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates , foreign exchange , equities , and commodities . the firm makes markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities , including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables . the firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit and other market risk exposure . the nature of the counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to which the firm is exposed . for otc

fair value of derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 54.2 billion and $ 56.5 billion at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively . derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government securities ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 15.3 billion and $ 16.1 billion at december 31 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative contracts move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , refer to note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of

    "Context": "citigroup 2019s repurchases are primarily from government sponsored entities . the specific representations and warranties made by the company depend on the nature of the transaction and the requirements of the buyer . market conditions and credit-ratings agency requirements may also affect representations and warranties and the other provisions the company may agree to in loan sales . in the event of a breach of the representations and warranties , the company may be required to either repurchase the mortgage loans ( generally at unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest ) with the identified defects or indemnify ( 201cmake-whole 201d ) the investor or insurer . the company has recorded a repurchase reserve that is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet . in the case of a repurchase , the company will bear any subsequent credit loss on the mortgage loans . the company 2019s representations and warranties are generally not subject to stated limits in amount or time of coverage . however , contractual liability arises only when the representations and warranties are breached and generally only when a loss results from the breach . in the case of a repurchase , the loan is typically considered a credit- impaired loan and accounted for under sop 03-3 , 201caccounting for certain loans and debt securities , acquired in a transfer 201d ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 , receivables 2014loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality ) . these repurchases have not had a material impact on nonperforming loan statistics , because credit-impaired purchased sop 03-3 loans are not included in nonaccrual loans . the company estimates its exposure to losses from its obligation to repurchase previously sold loans based on the probability of repurchase or make-whole and an estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole . this estimate is calculated separately by sales vintage ( i.e. , the year the loans were sold ) based on a combination of historical trends and forecasted repurchases and losses considering the : ( 1 ) trends in requests by investors for loan documentation packages to be reviewed ; ( 2 ) trends in recent repurchases and make-wholes ; ( 3 ) historical percentage of claims made as a percentage of loan documentation package requests ; ( 4 ) success rate in appealing claims ; ( 5 ) inventory of unresolved claims ; and ( 6 ) estimated loss given repurchase or make-whole , including the loss of principal , accrued interest , and foreclosure costs . the company does not change its estimation methodology by counterparty , but the historical experience and trends are considered when evaluating the overall reserve . the request for loan documentation packages is an early indicator of a potential claim . during 2009 , loan documentation package requests and the level of outstanding claims increased . in addition , our loss severity estimates increased during 2009 due to the impact of macroeconomic factors and recent experience . these factors contributed to a $ 493 million change in estimate for this reserve in 2009 . as indicated above , the repurchase reserve is calculated by sales vintage . the majority of the repurchases in 2009 were from the 2006 and 2007 sales vintages , which also represent the vintages with the largest loss- given-repurchase . an insignificant percentage of 2009 repurchases were from vintages prior to 2006 , and this is expected to decrease , because those vintages are later in the credit cycle . although early in the credit cycle , the company has experienced improved repurchase and loss-given-repurchase statistics from the 2008 and 2009 vintages . in the case of a repurchase of a credit-impaired sop 03-3 loan ( now incorporated into asc 310-30 ) , the difference between the loan 2019s fair value and unpaid principal balance at the time of the repurchase is recorded as a utilization of the repurchase reserve . payments to make the investor whole are also treated as utilizations and charged directly against the reserve . the provision for estimated probable losses arising from loan sales is recorded as an adjustment to the gain on sale , which is included in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . a liability for representations and warranties is estimated when the company sells loans and is updated quarterly . any subsequent adjustment to the provision is recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statement of income . the activity in the repurchase reserve for the years ended december 31 , 2009 and 2008 is as follows: .\n|in millions of dollars|2009|2008|\n|balance beginning of the year|$ 75|$ 2|\n|additions for new sales|33|23|\n|change in estimate|493|59|\n|utilizations|-119 ( 119 )|-9 ( 9 )|\n|balance end of the year|$ 482|$ 75|\ngoodwill goodwill represents an acquired company 2019s acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired . goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests , whereby goodwill is allocated to the company 2019s reporting units and an impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value . furthermore , on any business dispositions , goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the ratio of the fair value of the business disposed of to the fair value of the reporting unit . intangible assets intangible assets 2014including core deposit intangibles , present value of future profits , purchased credit card relationships , other customer relationships , and other intangible assets , but excluding msrs 2014are amortized over their estimated useful lives . intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives , primarily certain asset management contracts and trade names , are not amortized and are subject to annual impairment tests . an impairment exists if the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value . for other intangible assets subject to amortization , an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset . other assets and other liabilities other assets include , among other items , loans held-for-sale , deferred tax assets , equity-method investments , interest and fees receivable , premises and equipment , end-user derivatives in a net receivable position , repossessed assets , and other receivables. .",

the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits ( 201cutb 201d ) is as follows : ( millions ) federal , state , and foreign tax .\n|( millions )|federal state and foreign tax|\n|gross utb balance at january 1 2007|$ 691|\n|additions based on tax positions related to the current year|79|\n|additions for tax positions of prior years|143|\n|reductions for tax positions of prior years|-189 ( 189 )|\n|settlements|-24 ( 24 )|\n|reductions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations|-20 ( 20 )|\n|gross utb balance at december 31 2007|$ 680|\n|net utb impacting the effective tax rate at december 31 2007|$ 334|\nthe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that , if recognized , would affect the effective tax rate as of january 1 , 2007 and december 31 , 2007 , respectively , are $ 261 million and $ 334 million . the ending net utb results from adjusting the gross balance at december 31 , 2007 for items such as federal , state , and non-u.s . deferred items , interest and penalties , and deductible taxes . the net utb is included as components of accrued income taxes and other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet . the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense . at january 1 , 2007 and december 31 , 2007 , accrued interest and penalties on a gross basis were $ 65 million and $ 69 million , respectively . included in these interest and penalty amounts is interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility . because of the impact of deferred tax accounting , other than interest and penalties , the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period . in 2007 , the company completed the preparation and filing of its 2006 u.s . federal and state income tax returns , which did not result in any material changes to the company 2019s financial position . in 2006 , an audit of the company 2019s u.s . tax returns for years through 2001 was completed . the company and the internal revenue service reached a final settlement for these years , including an agreement on the amount of a refund claim to be filed by the company . the company also substantially resolved audits in certain european countries . in addition , the company completed the preparation and filing of its 2005 u.s . federal income tax return and the corresponding 2005 state income tax returns . the adjustments from amounts previously estimated in the u.s . federal and state income tax returns ( both positive and negative ) included lower u.s . taxes on dividends received from the company's foreign subsidiaries . the company also made quarterly adjustments ( both positive and negative ) to its reserves for tax contingencies . considering the developments noted above and other factors , including the impact on open audit years of the recent resolution of issues in various audits , these reassessments resulted in a reduction of the reserves in 2006 by $ 149 million , inclusive of the expected amount of certain refund claims . in 2005 , the company announced its intent to reinvest $ 1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 . this act provided the company the opportunity to tax- .",

their retirement years due to uncertainty surrounding the social security system and increases in average life expectancy . near-term , the industry and the company are experiencing lower variable

level of guarantees offered . in 2009 , the company intends to adjust pricing levels and take certain actions to reduce the risks in its variable annuity product features in order to address the risks

$ 1.5 billion in 2008 . the decrease in operating earnings was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin , driven by the 13% ( 13 % ) decrease in net sales and an unfavorable product mix . also contributing to the decrease in operating earnings was an increase in reorganization of business charges , relating primarily to higher employee severance costs . these factors were partially offset by decreased sg&a expenses and r&d expenditures , primarily related to savings from cost-reduction initiatives . as a percentage of net sales in 2009 as compared 2008 , gross margin decreased and r&d expenditures and sg&a expenses increased . net sales in north america continued to comprise a significant portion of the segment 2019s business , accounting for approximately 58% ( 58 % ) of the segment 2019s net sales in 2009 , compared to approximately 57% ( 57 % ) in 2008 . the regional shift in 2009 as compared to 2008 reflects a 16% ( 16 % ) decline in net sales outside of north america

the spanish , portu- guese and latin american markets and although pullmantur has diversified its passenger sourcing over the past few years , spain still represents pullmantur 2019s largest market . as previously disclosed , during 2012 european economies continued to demonstrate insta- bility in light of heightened concerns over sovereign debt issues as well as the impact of proposed auster- ity measures on certain markets . the spanish econ- omy was more severely impacted than many other economies and there is significant uncertainty as to when it will recover . in addition , the impact of the costa concordia incident has had a more lingering effect than expected and the impact in future years is uncertain . these factors were identified in the past as significant risks which could lead to the impairment of pullmantur 2019s goodwill . more recently , the spanish economy has progressively worsened and forecasts suggest the challenging operating environment will continue for an extended period of time . the unemployment rate in spain reached 26% ( 26 % ) during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is expected to rise further in 2013 . the international monetary fund , which had projected gdp growth of 1.8% ( 1.8 % ) a year ago , revised its 2013 gdp projections downward for spain to a contraction of 1.3% ( 1.3 % ) during the fourth quarter of 2012 and further reduced it to a contraction of 1.5% ( 1.5 % ) in january of 2013 . during the latter half of 2012 new austerity measures , such as increases to the value added tax , cuts to benefits , the phasing out of exemptions and the suspension of government bonuses , were implemented by the spanish government . we believe these austerity measures are having a larger impact on consumer confidence and discretionary spending than previously anticipated . as a result , there has been a significant deterioration in bookings from guests sourced from spain during the 2013 wave season . the combination of all of these factors has caused us to negatively adjust our cash flow projections , especially our closer-in net yield assumptions and the expectations regarding future capacity growth for the brand . based on our updated cash flow projections , we determined the implied fair value of goodwill for the pullmantur reporting unit was $ 145.5 million and rec- ognized an impairment charge of $ 319.2 million . this impairment charge was recognized in earnings during the fourth quarter of 2012 and is reported within impairment of pullmantur related assets within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income ( loss ) . there have been no goodwill impairment charges related to the pullmantur reporting unit in prior periods . see note 13 . fair value measurements and derivative instruments for further discussion . if the spanish economy weakens further or recovers more slowly than contemplated or if the economies of other markets ( e.g . france , brazil , latin america ) perform worse than contemplated in our discounted cash flow model , or if there are material changes to the projected future cash flows used in the impair- ment analyses , especially in net yields , an additional

trademarks and trade names relate to pullmantur and we have used a discount rate comparable to the rate used in valuing the pullmantur reporting unit in our goodwill impairment test . as described in note 3 . goodwill , the continued deterioration of the spanish economy caused us to negatively adjust our cash flow projections for the pullmantur reporting unit , especially our closer-in net yield

its subsidiaries from incurring certain liens or from entering into certain sale and lease-back transactions . some agreements also contain change in control provisions . however , they do not contain acceleration of maturity clauses that are dependent on credit ratings . a change in our credit ratings could limit our access to the u.s . short-term debt market and/or increase the cost of refinancing long-term debt in the future . however , even under these circumstances , we would continue to have access to our four-year credit agreement , which expires in march 2015 . this source of liquidity is unused and available on an unsecured basis , although we do not currently plan to use it . capital and credit markets , including commercial paper markets , continued to experience instability and disruption as the u.s . and global economies underwent a period of extreme uncertainty . throughout this period of uncertainty , we continued to have access to the u.s. , european , and canadian commercial paper markets . our commercial paper and term debt credit ratings were not affected by the changes in the credit environment . we monitor the financial strength of our third-party financial institutions , including those that hold our cash and cash equivalents as well as those who serve as counterparties to our credit facilities , our derivative financial instruments , and other arrangements . we are in compliance with all covenants as of december 29 , 2012 . we continue to believe that we will be able to meet our interest and principal repayment obligations and maintain our debt covenants for the foreseeable future , while still meeting our operational needs , including the pursuit of selected bolt-on acquisitions . this will be accomplished through our strong cash flow , our short- term borrowings , and our maintenance of credit facilities on a global basis. .",

and the perryville plant coming online in july 2005 ; n an increase of $ 12 million related to storm reserves . this increase does not include costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita ; and n an increase of $ 12 million due to a return to normal expense patterns in 2006 versus the deferral or capitalization of storm costs in 2005 . other operation and maintenance expenses increased for non- utility nuclear from $ 588 million in 2005 to $ 637 million in 2006 primarily due to the timing of refueling outages , increased benefit and insurance costs , and increased nrc fees . taxes other than income taxes taxes other than income taxes increased for the utility from $ 322 million in 2005 to $ 361 million in 2006 primarily due to an increase in city franchise taxes in arkansas due to a change in 2006 in the accounting for city franchise tax revenues as directed by the apsc . the change results in an increase in taxes other than income taxes with a corresponding increase in rider revenue , resulting in no effect on net income . also contributing to the increase was higher franchise tax expense at entergy gulf states , inc . as a result of higher gross revenues in 2006 and a customer refund in 2005 . other income other income increased for the utility from $ 111 million in 2005 to $ 156 million in 2006 primarily due to carrying charges recorded on storm restoration costs . other income increased for non-utility nuclear primarily due to miscellaneous income of $ 27 million ( $ 16.6 million net-of-tax ) resulting from a reduction in the decommissioning liability for a plant as a result of a revised decommissioning cost study and changes in assumptions regarding the timing of when decommissioning of a plant will begin . other income increased for parent & other primarily due to a gain related to its entergy-koch investment of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) in the fourth quarter of 2006 . in 2004 , entergy-koch sold its energy trading and pipeline businesses to third parties . at that time , entergy received $ 862 million of the sales proceeds in the form of a cash distribution by entergy-koch . due to the november 2006 expiration of contingencies on the sale of entergy-koch 2019s trading business , and the corresponding release to entergy-koch of sales proceeds held in escrow , entergy received additional cash distributions of approximately $ 163 million during the fourth quarter of 2006 and recorded a gain of approximately $ 55 million ( net-of-tax ) . entergy expects future cash distributions upon liquidation of the partnership will be less than $ 35 million . interest charges interest charges increased for the utility and parent & other primarily due to additional borrowing to fund the significant storm restoration costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita . discontinued operations in april 2006 , entergy sold the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the electric reliability council of texas ( ercot ) region of texas , and now reports this portion of the business as a discontinued operation . earnings for 2005 were negatively affected by $ 44.8 million ( net-of-tax ) of discontinued operations due to the planned sale . this amount includes a net charge of $ 25.8 million ( net-of-tax ) related to the impairment reserve for the remaining net book value of the competitive retail services business 2019 information technology systems . results for 2006 include an $ 11.1 million gain ( net-of-tax ) on the sale of the retail electric portion of the competitive retail services business operating in the ercot region of texas . income taxes the effective income tax rates for 2006 and 2005 were 27.6% ( 27.6 % ) and 36.6% ( 36.6 % ) , respectively . the lower effective income tax rate in 2006 is primarily due to tax benefits , net of reserves , resulting from the tax capital loss recognized in connection with the liquidation of entergy power international holdings , entergy 2019s holding company for entergy-koch . also contributing to the lower rate for 2006 is an irs audit settlement that allowed entergy to release from its tax reserves all settled issues relating to 1996-1998 audit cycle . see note 3 to the financial statements for a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate of 35.0% ( 35.0 % ) to the effective income tax rates , and for additional discussion regarding income taxes . liquidity and capital resources this section discusses entergy 2019s capital structure , capital spending plans and other uses of capital , sources of capital , and the cash flow activity presented in the cash flow statement . capital structure entergy 2019s capitalization is balanced between equity and debt , as shown in the following table . the increase in the debt to capital percentage from 2006 to 2007 is primarily the result of additional borrowings under entergy corporation 2019s revolving credit facility , along with a decrease in shareholders 2019 equity primarily due to repurchases of common stock . this increase in the debt to capital percentage is in line with entergy 2019s financial and risk management aspirations . the decrease in the debt to capital percentage from 2005 to 2006 is the result of an increase in shareholders 2019 equity , primarily due to an increase in retained earnings , partially

thus , there was no impairment of goodwill . goodwill impairment tests in 2017 and 2016 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of the company 2019s reporting units , except for the arconic forgings and extrusions ( afe ) business whose estimated fair value was lower than its carrying value . as such , arconic recorded an impairment for the full amount of goodwill in the afe reporting unit of $ 719 . the decrease in the afe fair value was primarily due to unfavorable performance that was impacting operating margins and a higher discount rate due to an increase in the risk-free rate of return , while the carrying value increased compared to prior year . other intangible assets . intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized while intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over the periods benefited . the following table details the weighted- average useful lives of software and other intangible assets by reporting segment ( numbers in years ) : .\n||software|other intangible assets|\n|engineered products and solutions|5|33|\n|global rolled products|5|9|\n|transportation and construction solutions|5|16|\nrevenue recognition . the company's contracts with customers are comprised of acknowledged purchase orders incorporating the company 2019s standard terms and conditions , or for larger customers , may also generally include terms under negotiated multi-year agreements . these contracts with customers typically consist of the manufacture of products which represent single performance obligations that are satisfied upon transfer of control of the product to the customer . the company produces fastening systems ;

increase borrowings to $ 1.5 billion with lender approval . following an extension agreement on september 17 , 2013 between the company and the syndicate of banks , the facility matures november 1 , 2017 , with a one-year extension option exercisable through october 31 , 2014 . no amounts were outstanding under this facility as of may 31 , 2014 or 2013 . we currently have long-term debt ratings of aa- and a1 from standard and poor 2019s corporation and moody 2019s investor services , respectively . if our long- term debt rating were to decline , the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase . conversely , if our long-term debt rating were to improve , the facility fee and interest rate would decrease . changes in our long-term debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility . under this committed revolving credit facility , we have agreed to various covenants . these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets , the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur , as well as a minimum capitalization ratio . in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant , and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate , any borrowings would become immediately due and payable . as of may 31 , 2014 , we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future . liquidity is also provided by our $ 1 billion commercial paper program . during the year ended may 31 , 2014 , we did not issue commercial paper , and as of may 31 , 2014 , there were no outstanding borrowings under this program . we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2015 depending on general corporate needs . we currently have

market funds , commercial paper , corporate notes , u.s . treasury obligations , u.s . government sponsored enterprise obligations , and other investment grade fixed income securities . our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk . all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk . while individual securities have varying durations , as of may 31 , 2014 the average duration of our short-term investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 126 days . to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs . future volatility in the capital markets , however , may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets . we believe that existing cash , cash equivalents , short-term investments , and cash generated by operations , together with access to external sources of funds as described above , will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future . we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed . we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which u.s . taxes have previously been provided . we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings , and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings . should we require additional capital in the united states , we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt . if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds , we would be required to accrue and pay additional u.s . taxes less applicable foreign tax credits . if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt , we would incur additional interest expense . off-balance sheet arrangements in connection with various contracts and agreements , we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights , coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor . currently , we have several such agreements in place . however , based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future

to the decline in commercial satellite deliveries . the $ 20 million increase in s&dms was attributable to higher volume on fleet ballistic missile and missile defense programs . in december 2006 , we completed a transaction with boeing to form ula , a joint venture which combines the production , engineering , test and launch operations associated with u.s . government launches of our atlas launch vehicles and boeing 2019s delta launch vehicles ( see related discussion on our 201cspace business 201d under 201cindustry considerations 201d ) . we are accounting for our investment in ula under the equity method of accounting . as a result , our share of the net earnings or losses of ula are included in other income and expenses , and we will no longer recognize sales related to launch vehicle services provided to the u.s . government . in 2006 , we recorded sales to the u.s . government for atlas launch services totaling approximately $ 600 million . we have retained the right to market commercial atlas launch services . we contributed assets to ula , and ula assumed liabilities related to our atlas business in exchange for our 50% ( 50 % ) ownership interest . the net book value of

from 2004 . income from our lpg operations in equatorial guinea increased in both periods due to higher sales volumes as a result of the plant expansions completed in 2005 . the increase in 2005 also included higher ptc income as a result of higher distillate gross margins . cost of revenues increased $ 4.609 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $ 7.106 billion in 2005 from 2004 . in both periods the increases were primarily in the rm&t segment and resulted from increases in acquisition costs of crude oil , refinery charge and blend stocks and purchased refined products . the increase in both periods was also impacted by higher manufacturing expenses , primarily the result of higher contract services and labor costs in 2006 and higher purchased energy costs in 2005 . purchases related to matching buy/sell transactions decreased $ 6.968 billion in 2006 from 2005 and increased $ 3.314 billion in 2005 from 2004 , mostly in the rm&t segment . the decrease in 2006 was primarily related to the change in accounting for matching buy/sell transactions discussed above . the increase in 2005 was primarily due to increased crude oil prices . depreciation , depletion and amortization increased $ 215 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 125 million in 2005 from 2004 . rm&t segment depreciation expense increased in both years as a result of the increase in asset value recorded for our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30 , 2005 . in addition , the detroit refinery expansion completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 contributed to the rm&t depreciation expense increase in 2006 . e&p segment depreciation expense for 2006 included a $ 20 million impairment of capitalized costs related to the camden hills field in the gulf of mexico and the associated canyon express pipeline . natural gas production from the camden hills field ended in 2006 as a result of increased water production from the well . selling , general and administrative expenses increased $ 73 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 134 million in 2005 from 2004 . the 2006 increase was primarily because personnel and staffing costs increased throughout the year primarily as a result of variable compensation arrangements and increased business activity . partially offsetting these increases were reductions in stock-based compensation expense . the increase in 2005 was primarily a result of increased stock-based compensation expense , due to the increase in our stock price during that year as well as an increase in equity-based awards , which was partially offset by a decrease in expense as a result of severance and pension plan curtailment charges and start-up costs related to egholdings in 2004 . exploration expenses increased $ 148 million in 2006 from 2005 and $ 59 million in 2005 from 2004 . exploration expense related to dry wells and other write-offs totaled $ 166 million , $ 111 million and $ 47 million in 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . exploration expense in 2006 also included $ 47 million for exiting the cortland and empire leases in nova scotia . net interest and other financing costs ( income ) reflected a net $ 37 million of income for 2006 , a favorable change of $ 183 million from the net $ 146 million expense in 2005 . net interest and other financing costs decreased $ 16 million in 2005 from 2004 . the favorable changes in 2006 included increased interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances , foreign currency exchange gains , adjustments to interest on tax issues and greater capitalized interest . the decrease in expense for 2005 was primarily a result of increased interest income on higher average cash balances and greater capitalized interest , partially offset by increased interest on potential tax deficiencies and higher foreign exchange losses . included in net interest and other financing costs ( income ) are foreign currency gains of $ 16 million , losses of $ 17 million and gains of $ 9 million for 2006 , 2005 and 2004 . minority interest in income of mpc decreased $ 148 million in 2005 from 2004 due to our acquisition of the 38 percent interest in mpc on june 30 , 2005 . provision for income taxes increased $ 2.308 billion in 2006 from 2005 and $ 979 million in 2005 from 2004 , primarily due to the $ 4.259 billion and $ 2.691 billion increases in income from continuing operations before income taxes . the increase in our effective income tax rate in 2006 was primarily a result of the income taxes related to our libyan operations , where the statutory income tax rate is in excess of 90 percent . the

deferred stock unit is a phantom share of our common stock , which requires liability accounting treatment until such awards are paid to the participants as cash . as there are no vesting or service requirements on these awards , total compensation expense is recognized in full on awarded deferred stock units on the date of grant . incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards the fair value of nonvested incentive/performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards is initially determined based on prices not less than the market value of our common stock price on the date of grant . the value of certain incentive/ performance unit share awards is subsequently remeasured based on the achievement of one or more financial and other performance goals generally over a three-year period . the personnel and compensation committee of the board of directors approves the final award payout with respect to incentive/performance unit share awards . restricted stock/unit awards have various vesting periods generally ranging from 36 months to 60 months . beginning in 2011 , we incorporated two changes to certain awards under our existing long-term incentive compensation programs . first , for certain grants of incentive performance units , the future payout amount will be subject to a negative annual adjustment if pnc fails to meet certain risk-related performance metrics . this adjustment is in addition to the existing financial performance metrics relative to our peers . these grants have a three-year performance period and are payable in either stock or a combination of stock and cash . second , performance-based restricted share units ( performance rsus ) were granted in 2011 to certain of our executives in lieu of stock options . these performance rsus ( which are payable solely in stock ) have a service condition , an internal risk-related performance condition , and an external market condition . satisfaction of the performance condition is based on four independent one-year performance periods . the weighted-average grant-date fair value of incentive/ performance unit share awards and restricted stock/unit awards granted in 2011 , 2010 and 2009 was $ 63.25 , $ 54.59 and $ 41.16 per share , respectively . we recognize compensation expense for such awards ratably over the corresponding vesting and/or

limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies . foreign exchange rate risk is reviewed as part of our risk management process . locally required capital levels are invested in home currencies in order to satisfy regulatory require- ments and to support local insurance operations regardless of currency fluctuations . the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british pound sterling , the euro , and the canadian dollar . the following table provides more information on our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk at december 31 , 2008 and 2007. .\n|(

reserves calculated in connection with the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees , primarily gmdb and gmib . these reserves are calculated in accordance with sop 03-1 ( sop reserves ) and changes in these reserves are reflected as life and annuity benefit expense , which is included in life underwriting income . in addition , our net income is directly impacted by the change in the fair value of the gmib liability ( fvl ) , which is classified as a derivative according to fas 133 . the fair value liability established for a gmib reinsurance contract represents the differ- ence between the fair value of the contract and the sop 03-1 reserves . changes in the fair value of the gmib liability , net of associated changes in the calculated sop 03-1 reserve , are reflected as realized gains or losses . ace views our variable annuity reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance , with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing . adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both life underwriting income and net income . when evaluating these risks , we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss , as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements . therefore , we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term eco- nomic risk and reward . the ultimate risk to the variable annuity guaranty reinsurance business is a long-term underperformance of investment returns , which can be exacerbated by a long-term reduction in interest rates . following a market downturn , continued market underperformance over a period of five to seven years would eventually result in a higher level of paid claims as policyholders accessed their guarantees through death or annuitization . however , if market conditions improved following a downturn , sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability would fall reflecting a decreased likelihood of future claims , which would result in an increase in both life underwriting income and net income . as of december 31 , 2008 , management established the sop 03-1 reserve based on the benefit ratio calculated using actual market values at december 31 , 2008 . management exercises judgment in determining the extent to which short-term market movements impact the sop 03-1 reserve . the sop 03-1 reserve is based on the calculation of a long-term benefit ratio ( or loss ratio ) for the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance . despite the long-term nature of the risk the benefit ratio calculation is impacted by short-term market movements that may be judged by management to be temporary or transient . management will , in keeping with the language in sop 03-1 , regularly examine both quantitative and qualitative analysis and management will determine if , in its judgment , the change in the calculated benefit ratio is of sufficient magnitude and has persisted for a sufficient duration to warrant a change in the benefit ratio used to establish the sop 03-1 reserve . this has no impact on either premium received or claims paid nor does it impact the long-term profit or loss of the variable annuity guaran- tee reinsurance . the sop 03-1 reserve and fair value liability calculations are directly affected by market factors , including equity levels , interest rate levels , credit risk and implied volatilities , as well as policyholder behaviors , such as annuitization and lapse rates . the table below shows the sensitivity , as of december 31 , 2008 , of the sop 03-1 reserves and fair value liability associated with the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . in addition , the tables below show the sensitivity of the fair value of specific derivative instruments held ( hedge value ) , which includes instruments purchased in january 2009 , to partially offset the risk in the variable annuity guarantee reinsurance portfolio . although these derivatives do not receive hedge accounting treatment , some portion of the change in value may be used to offset changes in the sop 03-1 reserve.

selection of an alternative for the soil remediation component of the overall site remedy . in october 2011 , the epa released a public statement indicating that the final soil remedy decision would be delayed . in the unlikely event that the epa changes its proposed soil remedy and approves instead a more expensive clean- up alternative , the remediation costs could be material , and significantly higher than amounts currently recorded . in october 2012 , the natural resource trustees for this site provided notice to international paper and other potentially responsible parties of their intent to perform a natural resource damage assessment . it is premature to predict the outcome of the assessment or to estimate a loss or range of loss , if any , which may be incurred . other

    "Context": "corporate & institutional banking corporate & institutional banking earned $ 1.9 billion in 2011 and $ 1.8 billion in 2010 . the increase in earnings was primarily due to an improvement in the provision for credit losses , which was a benefit in 2011 , partially offset by a reduction in the value of commercial mortgage servicing rights and lower net interest income . we continued to focus on adding new clients , increasing cross sales , and remaining committed to strong expense discipline . asset management group asset management group earned $ 141 million for 2011 compared with $ 137 million for 2010 . assets under administration were $ 210 billion at december 31 , 2011 and $ 212 billion at december 31 , 2010 . earnings for 2011 reflected a benefit from the provision for credit losses and growth in noninterest income , partially offset by higher noninterest expense and lower net interest income . for 2011 , the business delivered strong sales production , grew high value clients and benefitted from significant referrals from other pnc lines of business . over time and with stabilized market conditions , the successful execution of these strategies and the accumulation of our strong sales performance are expected to create meaningful growth in assets under management and noninterest income . residential mortgage banking residential mortgage banking earned $ 87 million in 2011 compared with $ 269 million in 2010 . the decline in earnings was driven by an increase in noninterest expense associated with increased costs for residential mortgage foreclosure- related expenses , primarily as a result of ongoing governmental matters , and lower net interest income , partially offset by an increase in loan originations and higher loans sales revenue . blackrock our blackrock business segment earned $ 361 million in 2011 and $ 351 million in 2010 . the higher business segment earnings from blackrock for 2011 compared with 2010 were

outside of our core business strategy . non-strategic assets portfolio had earnings of $ 200 million in 2011 compared with a loss of $ 57 million in 2010 . the increase was primarily attributable to a lower provision for credit losses partially offset by lower net interest income . 201cother 201d reported earnings of $ 376 million for 2011 compared with earnings of $ 386 million for 2010 . the

invest- ments ; interest rate swaps ; foreign exchange forwards ; commodity swaps , futures and options ; and equity instru- ments . the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities-related positions that are hedged by these market-risk-sensitive instruments . the table below presents the estimated maximum poten- tial one-day loss in fair value for our interest rate , foreign currency , commodity and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding on may 28 , 2006 and may 29 , 2005 , and the average amount outstanding during the year ended may 28 , 2006 . the amounts were calculated using the var methodology described above. .\n|in millions|fair value impact may 282006|fair value impact averageduring2006|fair value impact may 292005|\n|interest rate instruments|$ 8|$ 10|$ 18|\n|foreign currency instruments|2|1|1|\n|commodity instruments|2|2|1|\n|equity instruments|1|1|2013|\n.",

change in 2006 in the accounting for city franchise tax revenues as directed by the apsc . the change results in an increase in taxes other than income taxes with a corresponding increase in rider revenue , resulting in no effect on net income . also contributing to the increase was higher franchise tax expense at entergy gulf states , inc . as a result of higher gross revenues in 2006 and a

    "Context": "indemnification and repurchase claims are typically settled on an individual loan basis through make-whole payments or loan repurchases ; however , on occasion we may negotiate pooled settlements with investors . in connection with pooled settlements , we typically do not repurchase loans and the consummation of such transactions generally results in us no longer having indemnification and repurchase exposure with the investor in the transaction . for the first and second-lien mortgage balances of unresolved and settled claims contained in the tables below , a significant amount of these claims were associated with sold loans originated through correspondent lender and broker origination channels . in certain instances when indemnification or repurchase claims are settled for these types of sold loans , we have recourse back to the correspondent lenders , brokers and other third-parties ( e.g. , contract underwriting companies , closing agents , appraisers , etc. ) . depending on the underlying reason for the investor claim , we determine our ability to pursue recourse with these parties and file claims with them accordingly . our historical recourse recovery rate has been insignificant as our efforts have been impacted by the inability of such parties to reimburse us for their recourse obligations ( e.g. , their capital availability or whether they remain in business ) or factors that limit our ability to pursue recourse from these parties ( e.g. , contractual loss caps , statutes of limitations ) . origination and sale of residential mortgages is an ongoing business activity , and , accordingly , management continually assesses the need to recognize indemnification and repurchase liabilities pursuant to the associated investor sale agreements . we establish indemnification and repurchase liabilities for estimated losses on sold first and second-lien mortgages for which indemnification is expected to be provided or for loans that are expected to be repurchased . for the first and second- lien mortgage sold portfolio , we have established an indemnification and repurchase liability pursuant to investor sale agreements based on claims made , demand patterns observed to date and/or expected in the future , and our estimate of future claims on a loan by loan basis . to estimate the mortgage repurchase liability arising from breaches of representations and warranties , we consider the following factors : ( i ) borrower performance in our historically sold portfolio ( both actual and estimated future defaults ) , ( ii ) the level of outstanding unresolved repurchase claims , ( iii ) estimated probable future repurchase claims , considering information about file requests , delinquent and liquidated loans , resolved and unresolved mortgage insurance rescission notices and our historical experience with claim rescissions , ( iv ) the potential ability to cure the defects identified in the repurchase claims ( 201crescission rate 201d ) , and ( v ) the estimated severity of loss upon repurchase of the loan or collateral , make-whole settlement , or indemnification . see note 24 commitments and guarantees in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report for additional information . the following tables present the unpaid principal balance of repurchase claims by vintage and total unresolved repurchase claims for the past five quarters . table 28 : analysis of quarterly residential mortgage repurchase claims by vintage dollars in millions december 31 september 30 june 30 march 31 december 31 .\n|dollars in millions|december 31 2012|september 30 2012|june 30 2012|march 31 2012|december 312011|\n|2004 & prior|$ 11|$ 15|$ 31|$ 10|$ 11|\n|2005|8|10|19|12|13|\n|2006|23|30|56|41|28|\n|2007|45|137|182|100|90|\n|2008|7|23|49|17|18|\n|2008 & prior|94|215|337|180|160|\n|2009 2013 2012|38|52|42|33|29|\n|total|$ 132|$ 267|$ 379|$ 213|$ 189|\n|fnma fhlmc and gnma % (  % )|94% ( 94 % )|87% ( 87 % )|86% ( 86 % )|88% ( 88 % )|91% ( 91 % )|\nthe pnc financial services group , inc . 2013 form 10-k 79 .",

    "Context": "the aeronautics segment generally includes fewer programs that have much larger sales and operating results than programs included in the other segments . due to the large number of comparatively smaller programs in the remaining segments , the discussion of the results of operations of those business segments focuses on lines of business within the segment rather than on specific programs . the following tables of financial information and related discussion of the results of operations of our business segments are consistent with the presentation of segment information in note 5 to the financial statements . we have a number of programs that are classified by the u.s . government and cannot be specifically described . the operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results , and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs . aeronautics our aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research , design , development , manufacture , integration , sustainment , support , and upgrade of advanced military aircraft , including combat and air mobility aircraft , unmanned air vehicles , and related technologies . key combat aircraft programs include the f-35 lightning ii , f-16 fighting falcon , and f-22 raptor fighter aircraft . key air mobility programs include the c-130j super hercules and the c-5m super galaxy . aeronautics provides logistics support , sustainment , and upgrade modification services for its aircraft . aeronautics 2019 operating results included the following : ( in millions ) 2010 2009 2008 .\n|( in millions )|2010|2009|2008|\n|net sales|$ 13235|$ 12201|$ 11473|\n|operating profit|1502|1577|1433|\n|operating

three lines of business during the year . the $ 800 million increase in air mobility primarily was attributable to higher volume on c-130 programs , including deliveries and support activities , as well as higher volume on the c-5 reliability enhancement and re-engining program ( rerp ) . there were 25 c-130j deliveries in 2010 compared to 16 in 2009 . the $ 179 million increase in combat aircraft principally was due to higher volume on f-35 production contracts , which partially was offset by lower volume on the f-35 sdd contract and a decline in volume on f-16 , f-22 and other combat aircraft programs . there were 20 f-16 deliveries in 2010 compared to 31 in 2009 . the $ 55 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p-3 and advanced development programs , which partially were offset by a decline in volume on sustainment activities . net sales for aeronautics increased by 6% ( 6 % ) in 2009 compared to 2008 . during the year , sales increased in all three lines of business . the increase of $ 296 million in air mobility 2019s sales primarily was attributable to higher volume on the c-130 programs , including deliveries and support activities . there were 16 c-130j deliveries in 2009 and 12 in 2008 . combat aircraft sales increased $ 316 million principally due to higher volume on the f-35 program and increases in f-16 deliveries , which partially were offset by lower volume on f-22 and other combat aircraft programs . there were 31 f-16 deliveries in 2009 compared to 28 in 2008 . the $ 116 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was due to higher volume on p-3 programs and advanced development programs , which partially were offset by declines in sustainment activities . operating profit for the segment decreased by 5% ( 5 % ) in 2010 compared to 2009 . a decline in operating profit in combat aircraft partially was offset by increases in other aeronautics programs and air mobility . the $ 149 million decrease in combat aircraft 2019s operating profit primarily was due to lower volume and a decrease in the level of favorable performance adjustments on the f-22 program , the f-35 sdd contract and f-16 and other combat aircraft programs in 2010 . these decreases more than offset increased operating profit resulting from higher volume and improved performance on f-35 production contracts in 2010 . the $ 35 million increase in other aeronautics programs mainly was attributable to higher volume and improved performance on p-3 and advanced development programs as well as an increase in the level of favorable performance adjustments on sustainment activities in 2010 . the $ 19 million increase in air mobility operating profit primarily was due to higher volume and improved performance in 2010 on c-130j support activities , which more than offset a decrease in operating profit due to a lower level of favorable performance adjustments on c-130j deliveries in 2010 . the remaining change in operating profit is attributable to an increase in other income , net between the comparable periods . aeronautics 2019 2010 operating margins have decreased when compared to 2009 . the operating margin decrease reflects the life cycles of our significant programs . specifically , aeronautics is performing more development and initial production work on the f-35 program and is performing less work on more mature programs such as the f-22 and f-16 . development and initial production contracts yield lower profits than mature full rate programs . accordingly , while net sales increased in 2010 relative to 2009 , operating profit decreased and consequently operating margins have declined. .",

[2] estimated life , annuity and disability obligations include death and disability claims , policy surrenders , policyholder dividends and trail commissions offset by expected future deposits and premiums on in-force contracts . estimated contractual policyholder obligations are based on mortality , morbidity and lapse assumptions comparable with life 2019s historical experience , modified for recent observed trends . life has also assumed market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs . in contrast to this table , the majority of life 2019s obligations are recorded on the balance sheet at the current account value , as described in critical accounting estimates , and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth , interest crediting , or future deposits . therefore , the estimated contractual policyholder obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in reserve for future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses , other policyholder funds and benefits payable and separate account liabilities . due to the significance of the assumptions used , the amounts presented could materially differ from actual results . as separate account obligations are legally insulated from general account obligations , the separate account obligations will be fully funded by cash flows from separate account assets . life expects to fully fund the general account obligations from cash flows from general account investments and future deposits and premiums . [3] includes contractual principal and interest payments . payments exclude amounts associated with fair-value hedges of certain of the company 2019s long-term debt . all long-term debt obligations have fixed rates of interest . long-term debt obligations also includes principal and interest payments of $ 700 and $ 2.4 billion , respectively , related to junior subordinated debentures which are callable beginning in 2006 . see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of long-term debt obligations . [4] includes $ 1.4 billion in commitments to purchase investments including $ 330 of limited partnerships and $ 299 of mortgage loans . outstanding commitments under these limited partnerships and mortgage loans are included in payments due in less than 1 year since the timing of funding these commitments cannot be estimated . the remaining $ 759 relates to payables for securities purchased which are reflected on the company 2019s consolidated balance sheet . [5] includes estimated contribution of $ 200 to the company 2019s pension plan in 2005 . [6] as of december 31 , 2004 , the company has accepted cash collateral of $ 1.6 billion in connection with the company 2019s securities lending program and derivative instruments . since the timing of the return of the collateral is uncertain , the return of the collateral has been included in the payments due in less than 1 year .

2008 equity plan . the 1990 stock option plan and the 1995 incentive stock option plan terminated by their terms in march 2000 and february 2005 , respectively . the 2000 stock award plan , as amended , and the 2008 equity plan provide for the issuance of ( i ) incentive and non-qualified stock options , ( ii ) stock appreciation rights , ( iii ) restricted stock , ( iv ) restricted stock units and

no one individual shall be granted awards of more than 500000 shares . options and restricted stock units outstanding as of december 31 , 2009 vest in equal installments over four to five years from the date of grant . generally , options and restricted stock units are forfeited if the recipient ceases to be a director or employee before the shares vest . options are granted at a price not less than the fair value of the shares on the date of grant and expire not later than ten years after the date of grant . we also provide an employee stock purchase plan to facilitate the purchase by employees of up to 800000 shares of common stock in the aggregate . offerings to employees are made on a quarterly basis . subject to certain limitations , the purchase price for each share of common stock is equal to 90% ( 90 % ) of the average of the market prices of the common stock as reported on the new york stock exchange on the first business day of the purchase period and the last business day of each month of the purchase period . shares of common stock of 65005 , 36836 and 20759 were issued under the espp at a weighted-average price of $ 12.78 , $ 20.97 and $ 37.25 during 2009 , 2008

behalf . in january 2009 , the employment agreement and related trust agreement were amended . consequently , 768018 shares were distributed from the trust and future quarterly share distributions are issued directly to the chief executive officer . total compensation expenses recognized for employee stock-based compensation for the year ended december 31 , 2009 was $ 16.8 million . of this amount

fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black-scholes option pricing model . the estimated fair value of stock options , less estimated forfeitures , is amortized over the vesting period using the graded-vesting method . the assumptions used in the black-scholes option-pricing model are as follows : expected volatility was based on a combination of historical and implied volatilities . the risk-free interest rate is based on united states treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected option life assumed at the date of grant . the expected term was calculated based on historical experience and represents the time period options actually remain outstanding . we estimate forfeitures based on historical pre-vesting forfeiture rates and revise those estimates as appropriate to reflect actual experience . in 2008 , we increased our estimated forfeiture rate from 4% ( 4 % ) for options and 8.5% ( 8.5 % ) for restricted stock units to 20% ( 20 % ) to reflect changes in employee retention rates. .\n||2009|2008|2007|\n|dividend yield|0.0% ( 0.0 % )|1.9% ( 1.9 % )|1.3% ( 1.3 % )|\n|expected stock price

    "Context": "investment policy , which is described more fully in note 15 employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this report . we calculate the expense associated with the pension plan and the assumptions and methods that we use include a policy of reflecting trust assets at their fair market value . on an annual basis , we review the actuarial assumptions related to the pension plan , including the discount rate , the rate of compensation increase and the expected return on plan assets . the discount rate and compensation increase assumptions do not significantly affect pension expense . however , the expected long-term return on assets assumption does significantly affect pension expense . our expected long- term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension expense has been 8.25% ( 8.25 % ) for the past three years . the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption established by considering historical and anticipated returns of the asset classes invested in by the pension plan and the allocation strategy currently in place among those classes . while this analysis gives appropriate consideration to recent asset performance and historical returns , the assumption represents a long-term prospective return . we review this assumption at each measurement date and adjust it if warranted . for purposes of setting and reviewing this assumption , 201clong- term 201d refers to the period over which the plan 2019s projected benefit obligation will be disbursed . while year-to-year annual returns can vary significantly ( rates of return for the reporting years of 2009 , 2008 , and 2007 were +20.61% ( +20.61 % ) , -32.91% ( -32.91 % ) , and +7.57% ( +7.57 % ) , respectively ) , the assumption represents our estimate of long-term average prospective returns . our selection process references certain historical data and the current environment , but primarily utilizes qualitative judgment regarding future return expectations . recent annual returns may differ but , recognizing the volatility and unpredictability of investment returns , we generally do not change the assumption unless we modify our investment strategy or identify events that would alter our expectations of future returns . to evaluate the continued reasonableness of our assumption , we examine a variety of viewpoints and data . various studies have shown that portfolios comprised primarily of us equity securities have returned approximately 10% ( 10 % ) over long periods of time , while us debt securities have returned approximately 6% ( 6 % ) annually over long periods . application of these historical returns to the plan 2019s allocation of equities and bonds produces a result between 8% ( 8 % ) and 8.5% ( 8.5 % ) and is one point of reference , among many other factors , that is taken into consideration . we also examine the plan 2019s actual historical returns over various periods . recent experience is considered in our evaluation with appropriate consideration that , especially for short time periods , recent returns are not reliable indicators of future returns , and in many cases low returns in recent time periods are followed by higher returns in future periods ( and vice versa ) . acknowledging the potentially wide range for this assumption , we also annually examine the assumption used by other companies with similar pension investment strategies , so that we can ascertain whether our determinations markedly differ from other observers . in all cases , however , this data simply informs our process , which places the greatest emphasis on our qualitative judgment of future investment returns , given the conditions existing at each annual measurement date . the expected long-term return on plan assets for determining net periodic pension cost for 2009 was 8.25% ( 8.25 % ) , unchanged from 2008 . during 2010 , we intend to decrease the midpoint of the plan 2019s target allocation range for equities by approximately five percentage points . as a result of this change and taking into account all other factors described above , pnc will change the expected long-term return on plan assets to 8.00% ( 8.00 % ) for determining net periodic pension cost for 2010 . under current accounting rules , the difference between expected long-term returns and actual returns is accumulated and amortized to pension expense over future periods . each one percentage point difference in actual return compared with our expected return causes expense in subsequent years to change by up to $ 8 million as the impact is amortized into results of operations . the table below reflects the estimated effects on pension expense of certain changes in annual assumptions , using 2010 estimated expense as a baseline . change in assumption ( a ) estimated increase to 2010 pension expense ( in millions ) .\n|change in assumption ( a )|estimatedincrease to 2010pensionexpense ( inmillions )|\n|.5% ( .5 % ) decrease in discount rate|$ 10|\n|.5% ( .5 % ) decrease in expected long-term return on assets|$ 18|\n|.5% ( .5 % ) increase in compensation rate|$ 3|\n( a ) the impact is the effect of changing the specified assumption while holding all other assumptions constant . we currently estimate a pretax pension expense of $ 41 million in 2010 compared with pretax expense of $ 117 million in 2009 . this year-over-year reduction was primarily due to the amortization impact of the favorable 2009 investment returns as compared with the expected long-term return assumption . our pension plan contribution requirements are not particularly sensitive to actuarial assumptions . investment performance has the most impact on contribution requirements and will drive the amount of permitted contributions in future years . also , current law , including the provisions of the pension protection act of 2006 , sets limits as to both minimum and maximum contributions to the plan . we expect that the minimum required contributions under the law will be zero for 2010 . we maintain other defined benefit plans that have a less significant effect on financial results , including various .",

instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained . derivative receivables reported on the consolidated balance sheets were $ 56.5 billion and $ 64.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . derivative receivables decreased predominantly as a result of client- driven market-making activities in cib markets , which reduced foreign exchange and interest rate derivative receivables , and increased equity derivative receivables , driven by market movements . derivative receivables amounts represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities ( primarily u.s . government and agency securities and other group of seven nations ( 201cg7 201d ) government bonds ) and other cash collateral held by the firm aggregating $ 16.1 billion and $ 22.7 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , that may be used as security when the fair value of the client 2019s exposure is in the firm 2019s favor . in addition to the collateral described in the preceding paragraph , the firm also holds additional collateral ( primarily cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral does not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above , it is available as security against potential exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client 2019s derivative transactions move in the firm 2019s favor . the derivative receivables fair value , net of all collateral , also does not include other credit enhancements , such as letters of credit . for additional information on the firm 2019s use of collateral agreements , see note 5 . while useful as a current view of credit exposure , the net fair value of the derivative receivables does not capture the potential future variability of that credit exposure . to capture the potential future variability of credit exposure , the firm calculates , on a client-by-client basis , three measures of potential derivatives-related credit loss : peak , derivative risk equivalent ( 201cdre 201d ) , and average exposure ( 201cavg 201d ) . these measures all incorporate netting and collateral benefits , where applicable . peak represents a conservative measure of potential exposure to a counterparty calculated in a manner that is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% ( 97.5 % ) confidence level over the life of the transaction . peak is the primary measure used by the firm for setting of credit limits for derivative transactions , senior management reporting and derivatives exposure management . dre exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of derivative exposure on a basis intended to be equivalent to the risk of loan exposures . dre is a less extreme measure of potential credit loss than peak and is used for aggregating derivative credit risk exposures with loans and other credit risk . finally , avg is a measure of the expected fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables at future time periods , including the benefit of collateral . avg exposure over the total life of the derivative contract is used as the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used to calculate credit risk capital and the cva , as further described below . the three year avg exposure was $ 29.0 billion and $ 31.1 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively , compared with derivative receivables , net of all collateral , of $ 40.4 billion and $ 41.4 billion at december 31 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively . the fair value of the firm 2019s derivative receivables incorporates cva to reflect the credit quality of counterparties . cva is based on the firm 2019s avg to a counterparty and the counterparty 2019s credit spread in the credit derivatives market . the firm believes that active risk management is essential to controlling the dynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio . in addition , the firm 2019s risk management process takes into consideration the potential .",

margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions and can also cease provision of clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement . for further discussion of clearing services , refer to note 27 . derivative contracts derivatives enable clients and counterparties to manage risks including credit risk and risks arising from

associated with net open risk positions from its market-making activities , including the counterparty credit risk arising from derivative receivables . the firm also uses derivative instruments to

the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the firm . however , in management 2019s view , the

cash , g7 government securities , other liquid government-agency and guaranteed securities , and corporate debt and equity securities ) delivered by clients at the initiation of transactions , as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral that the firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date . although this collateral

impairment test at july 1 , 2010 , goodwill present in the reporting unit may be sensitive to further deterioration as the valuation of the reporting unit is particularly dependent upon economic conditions that affect consumer credit risk and behavior . citigroup engaged the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist in the valuation of the reporting unit at july 1 , 2010 , using a combination of the market approach and income approach consistent with the valuation model used in past practice , which considered the impact of the penalty fee provisions associated with the credit card accountability responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ( card act ) that were implemented during 2010 . under the market approach for valuing this reporting unit , the key assumption is the selected price multiple . the selection of the multiple considers the operating performance and financial condition of the local consumer lending 2014cards operations as compared with those of a group of selected publicly traded guideline companies and a group of selected acquired companies . among other factors , the level and expected growth in return on tangible equity relative to those of the guideline companies and guideline transactions is considered . since the guideline company prices used are on a minority interest basis , the selection of the multiple considers the guideline acquisition prices , which reflect control rights and privileges , in arriving at a multiple that reflects an appropriate control premium . for the local consumer lending 2014cards valuation under the income approach , the assumptions used as the basis for the model include cash flows for the forecasted period , the assumptions embedded in arriving at an estimation of the terminal value and the discount rate . the cash flows for the forecasted period are estimated based on management 2019s most recent projections available as of the testing date , giving consideration to targeted equity capital requirements based on selected public guideline companies for the reporting unit . in arriving at the terminal value for local consumer lending 2014cards , using 2013 as the terminal year , the assumptions used include a long-term growth rate and a price-to-tangible book multiple based on selected public guideline companies for the reporting unit . the discount rate is based on the reporting unit 2019s estimated cost of equity capital computed under the capital asset pricing model . embedded in the key assumptions underlying the valuation model , described above , is the inherent uncertainty regarding the possibility that economic conditions may deteriorate or other events will occur that will impact the business model for local consumer lending 2014cards . while there is inherent uncertainty embedded in the assumptions used in developing management 2019s forecasts , the company utilized a discount rate at july 1 , 2010 that it believes reflects the risk characteristics and uncertainty specific to management 2019s forecasts and assumptions for the local consumer lending 2014cards reporting unit . two primary categories of events exist 2014economic conditions in the u.s . and regulatory actions 2014which , if they were to occur , could negatively affect key assumptions used in the valuation of local consumer lending 2014cards . small deterioration in the assumptions used in the valuations , in particular the discount-rate and growth-rate assumptions used in the net income projections , could significantly affect citigroup 2019s impairment evaluation and , hence , results . if the future were to differ adversely from management 2019s best estimate of key economic assumptions , and associated cash flows were to decrease by a small margin , citi could potentially experience future material impairment charges with respect to $ 4560 million of goodwill remaining in the local consumer lending 2014 cards reporting unit . any such charges , by themselves , would not negatively affect citi 2019s tier 1 and total capital regulatory ratios , tier 1 common ratio , its tangible common equity or citi 2019s liquidity position.

makes matching contributions to the savings plan based upon participants 2019 savings , subject to certain limitations . for most participants not covered by a collective bargaining agreement , company-matching contributions are established each year at the discretion of the company and are applied to a maximum of 6% ( 6 % ) of eligible participant compensation . for those participants whose employment is covered by a collective bargaining agreement , the level of company- matching contribution , if any , is determined by the collective bargaining agreement . the company-matching contribution was 100% ( 100 % ) for 2008 and for the first two months of 2009 . the company- matching contribution was suspended from march 2009 through june 2010 as a cost savings measure in recognition of the adverse impact of the global recession . effective july 1 , 2010 , the company match was reinstated at 50% ( 50 % ) on the first 6% ( 6 % ) contributed for most employees eligible for the company-matching contribution feature . this would have included the bargained employees in accordance with their collective bargaining agreements . on january 1 , 2011 , the company match was

benefit recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of income related to the stock-based compensation was $ 18 million , $ 12 million and $ 12 million in 2010 , 2009 and 2008 , respectively . stock options ppg has outstanding stock option awards that have been granted under two stock option plans : the ppg industries , inc . stock plan ( 201cppg stock plan 201d ) and the ppg omnibus plan . under the ppg omnibus plan and the ppg stock plan , certain employees of the company have been granted options to purchase shares of common stock at prices equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date the options were granted . the options are generally exercisable beginning from six to 48 months after being granted and have a maximum term of 10 years . upon exercise of a stock option , shares of company stock are issued from treasury stock . the ppg stock plan includes a restored option provision for options originally granted prior to january 1 , 2003 that allows an optionee to exercise options and satisfy the option price by certifying ownership of mature shares of ppg common stock with equivalent market value . the fair value of stock options issued to employees is measured on the date of grant and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period . ppg estimates the fair value of stock options using the black-scholes option pricing model . the risk-free interest rate is determined by using the u.s . treasury yield curve at the date of the grant and using a maturity equal to the expected life of the option . the expected life of options is calculated using the average of the vesting term and the maximum term , as prescribed by accounting guidance on the use of the simplified method for determining the expected term of an employee share option . this method is used as the vesting term of stock options was changed to three years in 2004 and , as a result , the historical exercise data does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life of options . the expected dividend yield and volatility are based on historical stock prices and dividend amounts over past time periods equal in length to the expected life of the options . 66 2010 ppg annual report and form 10-k .",

shares of blackrock common stock , if any , the aggregate value of which ( the 201cconversion value 201d ) will be deter- mined by multiplying the applicable conversion rate by the average of the daily volume weighted average price of blackrock common stock for each of the ten consecutive trading days beginning on the second trading day imme- diately following the day the debentures are tendered for conversion ( the 201cten-day weighted average price 201d ) . the company will deliver the conversion value to holders as follows : ( 1 ) an amount in cash ( the 201cprincipal return 201d ) equal to the lesser of ( a ) the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted and ( b ) the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted , and ( 2 ) if the aggregate conversion value of the debentures to be converted is greater than the principal return , an amount in shares ( the 201cnet shares 201d ) , determined as set forth below , equal to such aggregate conversion value less the principal return ( the 201cnet share amount 201d ) . the number of net shares to be paid will be determined by dividing the net share amount by the ten-day weighted average price . in lieu of delivering fractional shares , the company will deliver cash based on the ten-day weighted average price . the conversion rate for the debentures is subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain corporate events , such as a change of control of the company , 193253ti_txt.indd 96 4/2/10 1:18 pm .",

    "Context": "decreased production volume as final aircraft deliveries were completed during the second quarter of 2012 and $ 50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter during the second quarter of 2012 ; and about $ 270 million for various other programs ( primarily sustainment activities ) due to decreased volume . the decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $ 295 million for f-35 production contracts due to increased production volume and risk retirements ; approximately $ 245 million for the c-5 program due to increased aircraft deliveries ( six aircraft delivered in 2013 compared to four in 2012 ) and other modernization activities ; and about $ 70 million for the f-35 development contract due to increased volume . aeronautics 2019 operating profit for 2013 decreased $ 87 million , or 5% ( 5 % ) , compared to 2012 . the decrease was primarily attributable to lower operating profit of about $ 85 million for the f-22 program , which includes approximately $ 50 million from the favorable resolution of a contractual matter in the second quarter of 2012 and about $ 35 million due to decreased risk retirements and production volume ; approximately $ 70 million for the c-130 program due to lower risk retirements and fewer deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activities ; about $ 65 million for the c-5 program due to the inception-to-date effect of reducing the profit booking rate in the third quarter of 2013 and lower risk retirements ; approximately $ 35 million for the f-16 program due to fewer aircraft deliveries partially offset by increased sustainment activity and aircraft configuration mix . the decreases were partially offset by higher operating profit of approximately $ 180 million for f-35 production contracts due to increased risk retirements and volume . operating profit was comparable for the f-35 development contract and included adjustments of approximately $ 85 million to reflect the inception-to-date impacts of the downward revisions to the profit booking rate in both 2013 and 2012 . adjustments not related to volume , including net profit booking rate adjustments and other matters , were approximately $ 75 million lower for 2013 compared to backlog backlog decreased slightly in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower orders on f-16 and f-22 programs . backlog decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 mainly due to lower orders on f-16 , c-5 and c-130 programs , partially offset by higher orders on the f-35 program . trends we expect aeronautics 2019 2015 net sales to be comparable or slightly behind 2014 due to a decline in f-16 deliveries as well as a decline in f-35 development activity , partially offset by an increase in production contracts . operating profit is also expected to decrease in the low single digit range , due primarily to contract mix , resulting in a slight decrease in operating margins between years . information systems & global solutions our is&gs business segment provides advanced technology systems and expertise , integrated information technology solutions and management services across a broad spectrum of applications for civil , defense , intelligence and other government customers . is&gs has a portfolio of many smaller contracts as compared to our other business segments . is&gs has been impacted by the continued downturn in certain federal agencies 2019 information technology budgets and increased re-competition on existing contracts coupled with the fragmentation of large contracts into multiple smaller contracts that are awarded primarily on the basis of price . is&gs 2019 operating results included the following ( in millions ) : .\n||2014|2013|2012|\n|net sales|$ 7788|$ 8367|$ 8846|\n|operating profit|699|759|808|\n|operating margins|9.0% ( 9.0 % )|9.1% ( 9.1 % )|9.1% ( 9.1 % )|\n|backlog at year-end|$ 8700|$ 8300|$ 8700|\n2014 compared to 2013 is&gs 2019 net sales decreased $ 579 million , or 7% ( 7 % ) , for 2014 compared to 2013 . the decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of about $ 645 million for 2014 due to the wind-down or completion of certain programs , driven by reductions in direct warfighter support ( including jieddo and ptds ) and defense budgets tied to command and control programs ; and approximately $ 490 million for 2014 due to a decline in volume for various ongoing programs , which reflects lower funding levels and programs impacted by in-theater force reductions . the decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of about $ 550 million for 2014 due to the start-up of new programs , growth in recently awarded programs and integration of recently acquired companies. .",
