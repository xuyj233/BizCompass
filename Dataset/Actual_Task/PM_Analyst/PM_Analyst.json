This is expected since we are adding an asset with a lower expected return (6%).\n*   **Risk Impact:** The key benefit is the significant risk reduction. The portfolio\u0027s standard deviation drops from 18% to 14.12%. This reduction is disproportionately large relative to the small drop in return.\n*   **Role of Negative Correlation:** This powerful risk reduction is a direct result of the -0.20 correlation. It means that the two assets tend to move in opposite directions. When the equity portion of the portfolio is performing poorly, the managed futures portion is likely to perform well, and vice versa. This effect smooths out the overall portfolio returns, leading to lower volatility (risk). This is a classic and powerful demonstration of the benefits of diversification."

The prevailing risk-free rate during this period was 2.0%.\n\n**Table 1: Security and Market Data**\n\n| | Realized Return | Beta |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Security | 10.5% | 0.8 |\n| Market | 12.0% | 1.0 |",
        "question": "Using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) as the benchmark for expected return, what was the security\u0027s abnormal return for the period?",
        "answer": "The abnormal return of a security is the difference between its actual (realized) return and its expected return as predicted by an asset pricing model like the CAPM.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the Expected Return using CAPM.**\nThe formula for the expected return E(R_i) of a security is given by the CAPM equation:\n\nE(R_i) = R_f + 尾_i 脳 (E(R_m) - R_f)\n\nWhere:\n- R_f = Risk-free rate = 2.0% or 0.02\n- 尾_i = Beta of the security = 0.8\n- E(R_m) = Expected market return (using realized return as proxy) = 12.0% or 0.12\n\nPlugging in the values from **Table 1**:\nE(R_i) = 0.02 + 0.8 脳 (0.12 - 0.02)\nE(R_i) = 0.02 + 0.8 脳 (0.10)\nE(R_i) = 0.02 + 0.08\nE(R_i) = 0.10 or 10.0%\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Abnormal Return.**\nThe abnormal return (alpha, 伪) is the realized return minus the expected return:\n\nAbnormal Return (伪) = Realized Return - Expected Return\n\nUsing the data:\nAbnormal Return = 10.5% - 10.0%\nAbnormal Return = 0.5%\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe security\u0027s abnormal return for the period was +0.5%. This indicates that the security outperformed its expected return, given its level of systematic risk, by 0.5% over the 12-month period."

The returns are conditional on the state of the market or, in the case of Asset 4, on rainfall. The firm\u0027s economists have provided the following probability distributions for each asset\u0027s returns.\n\n**Table 1: Asset 1 Return Distribution**\n| Market Condition | Return | Probability |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Good | 16% | 1/4 |\n| Average | 12% | 1/2 |\n| Poor | 8% | 1/4 |\n\n**Table 2: Asset 2 Return Distribution**\n| Market Condition | Return | Probability |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Good | 4% | 1/4 |\n| Average | 6% | 1/2 |\n| Poor | 8% | 1/4 |\n\n**Table 3: Asset 3 Return Distribution**\n| Market Condition | Return | Probability |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Good | 20% | 1/4 |\n| Average | 14% | 1/2 |\n| Poor | 8% | 1/4 |\n\n**Table 4: Asset 4 Return Distribution**\n| Rainfall | Return | Probability |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Plentiful | 16% | 1/3 |\n| Average | 12% | 1/3 |\n| Light | 8% | 1/3 |\n\nIt is assumed that there is no relationship between the amount of rainfall and the condition of the stock market. From prior analysis, the expected returns are known: E(R鈧? = 12%, E(R鈧? = 6%, E(R鈧? = 14%, E(R鈧? = 12%.",
        "question": "Solve for the covariance and correlation coefficient between Asset 4 and each of the other three assets (Asset 1, Asset 2, Asset 3).",
        "answer": "The core of this problem lies in the assumption that the drivers of returns are independent. The returns for Assets 1, 2, and 3 depend on \u0027Market Condition\u0027, while the returns for Asset 4 depend on \u0027Rainfall\u0027. The problem statement explicitly says, \u0027there is no relationship between the amount of rainfall and the condition of the stock market.\u0027\n\n**1. Theoretical Basis:**\nWhen two random variables (in this case, asset returns) are independent, their covariance is zero. The formula for covariance involves summing across all possible joint states of the world. Since the state spaces (Market Condition vs. Rainfall) are independent, the deviation of one asset\u0027s return from its mean provides no information about the other\u0027s deviation.\n\n*Cov(X, Y) = E[(X - E[X])(Y - E[Y])]*\nIf X and Y are independent, then *E[XY] = E[X]E[Y]*, and it follows that *Cov(X, Y) = 0*.\n\n**2. Calculation of Covariances:**\nBased on the independence assumption:\n*   Cov(R鈧? R鈧? = **0**\n*   Cov(R鈧? R鈧? = **0**\n*   Cov(R鈧? R鈧? = **0**\n\n**3. Calculation of Correlation Coefficients:**\nThe correlation coefficient is defined as the covariance divided by the product of the standard deviations.\n*Formula: Corr(X, Y) = Cov(X, Y) / (StdDev(X) * StdDev(Y))*\n\nSince the numerator (covariance) is 0 for all pairs involving Asset 4, the correlation coefficient will also be 0, as long as the standard deviations are non-zero (which they are).\n\n*   Corr(R鈧? R鈧? = 0 / (StdDev(R鈧? * StdDev(R鈧?) = **0**\n*   Corr(R鈧? R鈧? = 0 / (StdDev(R鈧? * StdDev(R鈧?) = **0**\n*   Corr(R鈧? R鈧? = 0 / (StdDev(R鈧? * StdDev(R鈧?) = **0**\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe covariance and correlation between Asset 4 and each of the other three assets are all **0**. This confirms that Asset 4 is a true diversifier whose returns are statistically independent of the market-driven assets."

A significant portion of her compensation is a year-end cash bonus (蠂虄), which is heavily dependent on the company\u0027s performance and thus correlated with its stock return (螞虄). She wants to invest a portion of her personal wealth in a portfolio of financial assets, including her own company\u0027s stock. Her utility is CARA with a risk aversion coefficient of 伪 = 0.00002.\n\nYour goal is to determine the optimal dollar amount (蠁) the executive should invest in her company\u0027s stock. This calculation must explicitly account for the non-tradable risk from her bonus. You need to separate the total investment into its two key components: the speculative demand (investment based on risk-return tradeoff) and the hedging demand (investment to offset the background bonus risk).\n\nWhen an investor faces a non-tradable background risk (like labor income) that is correlated with a tradable asset, the optimal investment in that asset (蠁) is composed of two parts: a speculative demand (蠁*) and a hedging demand (-b).\n\n**Formula 1:**\n$$ \\phi = \\phi^* - b $$\n\nThe speculative demand, 蠁*, is the optimal investment if there were no background risk.

Because her bonus is highly and positively correlated with the stock\u0027s performance, she is already \u0027long\u0027 the company\u0027s prospects through her compensation. The large short position in the stock is necessary to hedge this significant, non-diversifiable background risk.

To determine the optimal strategy, we must first calculate the excess returns (returns above the risk-free rate) for each risky asset.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate Excess Returns**\nThe excess return for an asset is its expected return minus the risk-free rate (`E(R) - R_F`).\n*   **Excess Return for Security 1:** 10% (Expected Return) - 10% (Risk-Free Rate) = 0%\n*   **Excess Return for Security 2:** 4% (Expected Return) - 10% (Risk-Free Rate) = -6%\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the Results**\n*   Security 1 offers an expected return equal to the risk-free rate, but with added risk (standard deviation of 5%). A rational, risk-averse investor would prefer the risk-free asset over Security 1, as it provides the same return with zero risk.\n*   Security 2 offers an expected return that is *less* than the risk-free rate. It has a negative excess return, making it an unattractive investment on its own.\n\n**Step 3: Formulate the Optimal Strategy**\nSince neither risky asset offers a positive excess return, no combination of these assets can produce a portfolio with a Sharpe Ratio greater than zero. The risk-free asset itself has a Sharpe Ratio of zero. Any portfolio including Security 2 would have a negative Sharpe Ratio, and any portfolio with only Security 1 would have a Sharpe Ratio of zero but with unnecessary risk.\n\nTherefore, there is no benefit to investing in the risky securities in this scenario. The \u0027tangency portfolio\u0027 effectively collapses to the risk-free asset itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe optimal investment strategy is to allocate **100% of the funds to the risk-free asset**, which provides a guaranteed return of 10% with zero risk."

A key principle of portfolio theory is that this entire frontier can be traced by finding any two distinct portfolios that lie on it and then calculating all possible combinations of those two.\n\nTo generate such portfolios, one can use the tangency portfolio calculation method for different hypothetical risk-free rates. For instance, one efficient portfolio can be found using a hypothetical $R_F = 4\\%$, and a second can be found using a hypothetical $R_F = 8\\%$.

The process involves generating two distinct efficient portfolios and then mapping their combinations.\n\n**Step 1: Generate a First Efficient Portfolio (Portfolio 1).**\nWe can generate an efficient portfolio by finding the tangency portfolio for an arbitrarily chosen risk-free rate. Let\u0027s use $R_F = 4\\%$. The calculation for this portfolio (as performed in a separate analysis) yields the following weights: $X_1 = -6.4\\%$, $X_2 = -14.1\\%$, $X_3 = 11.7\\%$, $X_4 = -1.3\\%$, $X_5 = -25.8\\%$, $X_6 = 4.7\\%$, $X_7 = -14.3\\%$, $X_8 = -0.6\\%$, $X_9 = 122.1\\%$, $X_{10} = 24.1\\%$. Let\u0027s call this Portfolio 1.\n\n**Step 2: Generate a Second, Distinct Efficient Portfolio (Portfolio 2).**\nTo find a second portfolio on the frontier, we repeat the entire tangency portfolio calculation process using a different risk-free rate. For example, let\u0027s choose $R_F = 8\\%$. This would involve:\n*   a. Re-calculating the excess return to standard deviation ratios, $(\\overline{R}_i - 8) / \\sigma_i$, for all 10 securities.\n*   b. Re-calculating the cut-off rate, $C^*$, using the new sum of ratios.\n*   c. Re-calculating the intermediate weights, $Z_i$, using the new $C^*$.\n*   d. Re-calculating the final weights, $X_i$, to define Portfolio 2.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the Expected Return and Variance for Portfolio 1 and Portfolio 2.**\nFor each of the two portfolios, we must calculate their aggregate expected return and variance.\n*   $\\overline{R}_p = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} X_i \\overline{R}_i$\n*   $\\sigma_p^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sum_{j=1}^{10} X_i X_j \\sigma_{ij}$. Since $\\sigma_{ij} = \\rho_{ij} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j$ and $\\rho_{ij}=0.5$ for $i \\neq j$ and $\\rho_{ii}=1$, this becomes a detailed but straightforward calculation.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Covariance between Portfolio 1 and Portfolio 2 ($\\sigma_{12}$).**\nThe covariance is calculated as:\n$$ \\sigma_{12} = \\sum_{i=1}^{10} \\sum_{j=1}^{10} X_{i,1} X_{j,2} \\sigma_{ij} $$\nwhere $X_{i,1}$ is the weight of security $i$ in Portfolio 1 and $X_{j,2}$ is the weight of security $j$ in Portfolio 2.\n\n**Step 5: Trace the Locus of Combinations.**\nThe full set of portfolios that can be formed by combining Portfolio 1 and Portfolio 2 is described by varying the weight $w$ in **Formula 1** and **Formula 2** from $-\\infty$ to $+\\infty$. Plotting the resulting $(\\sigma_{new}, \\overline{R}_{new})$ pairs generates a hyperbola.

They are now considering consolidating these assets under your firm\u0027s management and want to understand the potential benefits of a unified strategy. They have provided you with the risk and return characteristics of each portfolio.\n\nYour task is to analyze the investment opportunity set created by combining the two existing portfolios. Specifically, you must identify the single combination with the lowest possible risk (the Minimum Variance Portfolio) and describe the full range of efficient portfolios that can be constructed. This analysis will demonstrate the risk-reduction and return-enhancement possibilities of active allocation between the two underlying portfolios.\n\nYou are given the performance characteristics of two efficient portfolios, A and B. Short sales are permitted, allowing for any combination of the two.\n\n**Table 1: Portfolio Characteristics**\n| | Portfolio A | Portfolio B |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Expected Return | 10% | 8% |\n| Standard Deviation | 6% | 4% |\n\n The covariance of returns between Portfolio A and Portfolio B is given as $\\sigma_{AB} = 20$. Note that the returns and standard deviations are expressed in percentages, so the variance values will be in units of percent-squared.\n\nTo find the Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP) composed of two assets (or portfolios) A and B, the weight in Portfolio A is given by **Formula 1**:\n\n**Formula 1: Weight of Asset A in the MVP**\n$$ X_A = \\frac{\\sigma_B^2 - \\sigma_{AB}}{\\sigma_A^2 + \\sigma_B^2 - 2\\sigma_{AB}} $$",
        "question": "First, calculate the weights of Portfolio A and Portfolio B in the combined Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP). Second, determine the expected return and standard deviation of this MVP. Finally, describe the efficient frontier that is formed by combining portfolios A and B.",
        "answer": "We will analyze the combination of the two portfolios by first finding the minimum variance combination and then describing the efficient set of all other combinations.\n\n**Step 1: Find the weights of the Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP).**\nWe are given:\n*   Expected Return: $\\overline{R}_A = 10\\%$, $\\overline{R}_B = 8\\%$\n*   Standard Deviation: $\\sigma_A = 6\\%$, $\\sigma_B = 4\\%$\n*   Covariance: $\\sigma_{AB} = 20$ (%-squared)\n\nFirst, we calculate the variances:\n*   $\\sigma_A^2 = (6\\%)^2 = 36$ (%-squared)\n*   $\\sigma_B^2 = (4\\%)^2 = 16$ (%-squared)\n\nUsing **Formula 1**, we find the weight of Portfolio A in the MVP:\n$$ X_A = \\frac{\\sigma_B^2 - \\sigma_{AB}}{\\sigma_A^2 + \\sigma_B^2 - 2\\sigma_{AB}} = \\frac{16 - 20}{36 + 16 - 2(20)} = \\frac{-4}{52 - 40} = \\frac{-4}{12} = -0.3333 $$\nSo, the weight in Portfolio A is -33.33%.\n\nThe weight in Portfolio B is found by $X_B = 1 - X_A$:\n$$ X_B = 1 - (-0.3333) = 1.3333 $$\nSo, the weight in Portfolio B is 133.33%.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expected return and standard deviation of the MVP.**\nThe expected return of the MVP is:\n$$ \\overline{R}_{MVP} = X_A \\overline{R}_A + X_B \\overline{R}_B = (-0.3333)(10\\%) + (1.3333)(8\\%) = -3.333\\% + 10.666\\% = 7.333\\% $$\nThe variance of the MVP is:\n$$ \\sigma_{MVP}^2 = X_A^2 \\sigma_A^2 + X_B^2 \\sigma_B^2 + 2 X_A X_B \\sigma_{AB} $$\n$$ \\sigma_{MVP}^2 = (-0.3333)^2(36) + (1.3333)^2(16) + 2(-0.3333)(1.3333)(20) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{MVP}^2 = (0.1111)(36) + (1.7777)(16) - (0.8889)(20) $$\n$$ \\sigma_{MVP}^2 = 4.00 + 28.44 - 17.78 = 14.66 $$\nThe standard deviation of the MVP is:\n$$ \\sigma_{MVP} = \\sqrt{14.66} \\approx 3.83\\% $$\n\n**Step 3: Describe the efficient frontier.**\nThe MVP represents the point of minimum risk achievable by combining portfolios A and B, which is $(\\sigma=3.83\\%, \\overline{R}=7.33\\%)$. The efficient frontier is the set of all combinations of A and B that have an expected return greater than or equal to that of the MVP. In a risk-return graph, this corresponds to the upper arm of the hyperbola that passes through the points representing Portfolio A $(\\sigma=6\\%, \\overline{R}=10\\%)$, Portfolio B $(\\sigma=4\\%, \\overline{R}=8\\%)$, and has its vertex at the MVP.\n\n**Conclusion:** The lowest risk portfolio achievable has an expected return of 7.33% and a standard deviation of 3.83%. The efficient frontier consists of all combinations of Portfolios A and B that yield an expected return of 7.33% or higher."

It is defined by **Formula 1**:\n\n**Formula 1:**\n$$ \\mathrm{IR}_P = \\frac{E[R_P - R_{B}]}{\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[R_P - R_{B}]}} $$\n\nwhere $R_P$ is the portfolio\u0027s return and $R_B$ is the benchmark\u0027s return. The numerator, $E[R_P - R_{B}]$, is the active return (or alpha), and the denominator, $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[R_P - R_{B}]}$, is the tracking error.\n\nFor the manager you are evaluating, you have the following annualized data:\n- Portfolio Expected Return ($E[R_P]$): 14%\n- Benchmark Expected Return ($E[R_B]$): 11%\n- Tracking Error ($\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[R_P - R_{B}]}$): 5%",
        "question": "Using the provided data and **Formula 1**, calculate the Information Ratio for this active manager\u0027s portfolio.",
        "answer": "**Step 1: Identify the components of the Information Ratio formula.**\nThe formula for the Information Ratio is:\n$$ \\mathrm{IR}_P = \\frac{\\text{Active Return}}{\\text{Tracking Error}} $$\nWe are given the following values:\n- Portfolio Expected Return, $E[R_P] = 14\\%$\n- Benchmark Expected Return, $E[R_B] = 11\\%$\n- Tracking Error, $\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Var}[R_P - R_{B}]} = 5\\%$\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Active Return (Numerator).**\nThe active return is the difference between the portfolio\u0027s expected return and the benchmark\u0027s expected return.\n$$ \\text{Active Return} = E[R_P] - E[R_B] = 14\\% - 11\\% = 3\\% $$\n\n**Step 3: Identify the Tracking Error (Denominator).**\nThe tracking error is given directly in the problem statement as 5%.\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the Information Ratio.**\nNow we can plug the active return and tracking error into **Formula 1**:\n$$ \\mathrm{IR}_P = \\frac{3\\%}{5\\%} = 0.6 $$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Information Ratio for the active manager\u0027s portfolio is 0.6. This value provides a standardized measure of the manager\u0027s skill in generating excess returns per unit of risk taken relative to the benchmark."

If the SDF is strictly positive ($m_i \u003e 0$ for all states), such an opportunity cannot exist because the expected value $E[\\tilde{m}\\tilde{x}]$ must be positive.\n\nAn analyst has identified a portfolio with the following characteristics:\n- **Market States:** Three possible states ($s_1, s_2, s_3$) with equal probability (prob($s_i$) = 1/3 for each).\n- **Portfolio Cost:** The portfolio can be constructed at zero cost ($p=0$).\n- **Portfolio Payoffs ($\"x_i\"$):**\n  - Payoff in state $s_1$: $0\n  - Payoff in state $s_2$: $15\n  - Payoff in state $s_3$: $0\n- **Firm\u0027s SDF ($\"m_i\"$):** Your firm\u0027s model uses the following SDF vector for this market: $(m_1, m_2, m_3) = (1.2, 0.9, 0.8)$.",
        "question": "Using **Formula 1**, calculate the theoretical, arbitrage-free price of the analyst\u0027s portfolio. Based on your calculation, determine if the portfolio represents a true arbitrage opportunity under the firm\u0027s SDF model.",
        "answer": "**Step 1: Verify the Conditions for a Potential Arbitrage**\nFirst, we check if the portfolio\u0027s characteristics match the definition of an arbitrage opportunity before pricing.\n- **Condition 1: Price $p \\le 0$.** The portfolio\u0027s cost is given as $p=0$. This condition is met.\n- **Condition 2: Payoff $\\tilde{x} \\ge 0$.** The payoff vector is $(0, 15, 0)$. All payoffs are non-negative. This condition is met.\n- **Condition 3: Strictly positive payoff in at least one state.** The payoff in state $s_2$ is 15, which is greater than 0. This condition is met.\nThe portfolio meets the criteria for a potential arbitrage opportunity.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the Theoretical Price using the SDF**\nNow, we use **Formula 1** to find the price that is consistent with the firm\u0027s no-arbitrage model (i.e., the positive SDF).\n$$ p_{theoretical} = E[\\tilde{m}\\tilde{x}] = \\text{prob}(s_1)m_1x_1 + \\text{prob}(s_2)m_2x_2 + \\text{prob}(s_3)m_3x_3 $$\n\nSubstitute the given values:\n$$ p_{theoretical} = (1/3)(1.2)(0) + (1/3)(0.9)(15) + (1/3)(0.8)(0) $$\n$$ p_{theoretical} = 0 + (1/3)(13.5) + 0 $$\n$$ p_{theoretical} = 4.5 $$\n\n**Step 3: Compare Theoretical Price with Actual Cost and Conclude**\n- The theoretical price, consistent with the absence of arbitrage and the firm\u0027s SDF, is $4.5.\n- The actual market cost of the portfolio is $0.\n\nSince the theoretical price ($4.5) is not equal to the market price ($0), a discrepancy exists. Because the portfolio\u0027s payoff is non-negative and the SDF is strictly positive, the theoretical price must be positive. The fact that the portfolio can be acquired for a price of $0$ means its price is too low relative to its payoff structure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nYes, the portfolio represents a true arbitrage opportunity. An investor can acquire this portfolio for free ($p=0$) and receive a payoff that is guaranteed to be non-negative, with a positive payoff in state $s_2$. The theoretical price of $4.5 shows what the portfolio *should* cost in an arbitrage-free market governed by the given SDF."

This matrix will serve as the bridge between the manager\u0027s subjective opinions and the model\u0027s optimization engine.\n\nThe Black-Litterman model uses a \u0027pick-matrix\u0027, denoted as $P$, to formally define an investor\u0027s views.

        "answer": "To evaluate the fund manager\u0027s performance, we will calculate Jensen\u0027s alpha using the provided data and **Formula 1**.\n\n**Step 1: Identify the inputs**\n\n- Portfolio\u0027s actual return ($R_P$): 8.5% or 0.085\n- Risk-free rate ($R_f$): 2.0% or 0.02\n- Portfolio\u0027s beta ($\\beta_P$): 1.1\n- Market return ($R_M$): 10.0% or 0.10\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the expected return of the portfolio using CAPM**\n\nThe CAPM expected return is the bracketed part of **Formula 1**: $E(R_P) = R_f + \\beta_P (R_M - R_f)$.\n\n$$ E(R_P) = 0.02 + 1.1 \\times (0.10 - 0.02) $$\n$$ E(R_P) = 0.02 + 1.1 \\times (0.08) $$\n$$ E(R_P) = 0.02 + 0.088 $$\n$$ E(R_P) = 0.108 \\text{ or } 10.8\\% $$\n\nThis is the return the portfolio should have achieved given its level of systematic risk.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Jensen\u0027s Alpha**\n\nNow, we subtract the expected return from the actual return.\n\n$$ \\alpha_P = R_P - E(R_P) $$\n$$ \\alpha_P = 0.085 - 0.108 $$\n$$ \\alpha_P = -0.023 \\text{ or } -2.3\\% $$\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe Jensen\u0027s alpha for the managed fund is -2.3%. This negative alpha indicates that the fund has underperformed its CAPM-predicted benchmark by 2.3% for the year. The manager did not add value and, in fact, detracted from it relative to the risk taken."

The two companies have different capital structures (NCI has a higher debt-to-equity ratio) and tax situations. EV/EBITDA is superior to a metric like P/E because it is capital structure-neutral. By using Enterprise Value (which includes both debt and equity) and a pre-interest, pre-tax earnings figure (EBITDA), the multiple provides a more direct comparison of the value of the underlying business operations, independent of financing and tax differences.\n\n**Conclusion:** RGI is the recommended company because it appears relatively undervalued based on its lower EV/EBITDA multiple, which is the most suitable metric for comparing these two firms."

This will allow you to compare its attractiveness relative to other bonds in the market.\n\nGrupo Ignacia issued 10-year corporate bonds four years ago. The bonds pay an annualized coupon of 10.7 percent on a semiannual basis, and the current price of the bonds is MXN97.50 per MXN100 of par value.",
        "question": "The Yield to Maturity (YTM) of the bonds is closest to:",
        "answer": "To find the Yield to Maturity (YTM), we need to solve for the discount rate that equates the present value of the bond\u0027s future cash flows to its current market price. This is typically done with a financial calculator.\n\n1.  **Determine the number of periods (N):** The bond was issued 4 years ago with a 10-year maturity, so it has 6 years remaining. Since payments are semiannual, the total number of periods is 6 years * 2 = 12 periods.\n\n2.  **Determine the present value (PV):** The current market price is MXN97.50. This is a cash outflow if we purchase the bond, so we enter it as -97.50.\n\n3.  **Determine the coupon payment per period (PMT):** The annualized coupon is 10.7%. The semiannual coupon payment is (10.7% / 2) * MXN100 par value = MXN 5.35.\n\n4.  **Determine the future value (FV):** The bond\u0027s par value, paid at maturity, is MXN 100.\n\n**Calculation using a financial calculator:**\n*   N = 12\n*   PV = -97.50\n*   PMT = 5.35\n*   FV = 100\n\nComputing the interest rate per period (CPT I/Y) yields 5.64%.\n\n5.  **Annualize the YTM:** The calculated rate of 5.64% is the semiannual yield. To get the annualized YTM (bond equivalent yield), we multiply by 2.\n    Annualized YTM = 5.64% * 2 = 11.28%\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe YTM of the bonds is closest to 11.28 percent."

DI獗? * [FI岬?- E(R_FI)] * [DI獗?- E(R_DI)]\nWe sum this product over all non-zero probability states:\n\n*   **State 1 (P=0.25):** R_FI = 25%, R_DI = 30%\n    Term 1 = 0.25 * (25 - 16.25) * (30 - 23.75) = 0.25 * (8.75) * (6.25) = 13.671875\n\n*   **State 2 (P=0.50):** R_FI = 15%, R_DI = 25%\n    Term 2 = 0.50 * (15 - 16.25) * (25 - 23.75) = 0.50 * (-1.25) * (1.25) = -0.78125\n\n*   **State 3 (P=0.25):** R_FI = 10%, R_DI = 15%\n    Term 3 = 0.25 * (10 - 16.25) * (15 - 23.75) = 0.25 * (-6.25) * (-8.75) = 13.671875\n\n**Sum the terms:**\nCov(FI, DI) = 13.671875 - 0.78125 + 13.671875 = 26.5625\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe covariance of returns on the foreign index and the domestic index is closest to 26.56."

The fund is currently evaluating a set of newly listed state-contingent claims (Arrow securities) in a market with two possible future economic states: \u0027Boom\u0027 and \u0027Bust\u0027.\n\nYour task is to analyze the pricing of these Arrow securities to determine if the market adheres to the Law of One Price and, more importantly, if any arbitrage opportunities exist that the fund can exploit.\n\nIn a market with two states, an Arrow security for a given state pays $1 if that state occurs and $0 otherwise. The existence of a complete set of Arrow securities allows for the replication of any payoff profile. The Law of One Price (LOP) states that any two assets or portfolios with the same payoff profile must have the same price.\n\nAn arbitrage is an investment strategy that generates a non-negative payoff in all states of the world and a strictly positive payoff in at least one state, with zero initial cost, or a strategy that has a negative initial cost (i.e., you get paid to take it) but a non-negative payoff in all future states.\n\nThe fund has observed the following prices for the two Arrow securities in the market:\n\n*   **Security 1 (pays in \u0027Boom\u0027):** Price $p_1 = \\$0.60$\n*   **Security 2 (pays in \u0027Bust\u0027):** Price $p_2 = -\\$0.05$\n\nThis market is complete, as any payoff vector $(\\tilde{x}_1, \\tilde{x}_2)$ can be constructed by buying $x_1$ units of Security 1 and $x_2$ units of Security 2. The unique cost for this payoff is given by **Formula 1**:\n\n**Formula 1:**\n$$ \\text{Cost} = p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2 $$",
        "question": "First, determine if the Law of One Price holds in this market. Second, determine if there is an arbitrage opportunity. Justify your answers.",
        "answer": "### Part 1: Verifying the Law of One Price\n\nThe Law of One Price requires that any specific payoff profile has a single, unique price. In this market, any payoff profile, represented by the vector $(x_1, x_2)$, can be perfectly replicated by a unique portfolio of the two Arrow securities. According to **Formula 1**, the cost to construct this payoff is $p_1 x_1 + p_2 x_2$. Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are fixed prices, for any given payoff $(x_1, x_2)$, the cost is uniquely determined.\n\nFor example, a payoff of ($10, $5) would have a unique cost of: \n$$ \\text{Cost} = (0.60)(10) + (-0.05)(5) = 6.00 - 0.25 = \\$5.75 $$\nThere is no other way to construct this payoff, and it has only one price. Therefore, **the Law of One Price holds** by construction.\n\n### Part 2: Identifying Arbitrage Opportunities\n\nAn arbitrage opportunity exists if one can achieve a non-negative payoff with a negative initial cost.\n\nConsider purchasing one unit of Security 2. \n*   **Initial Cost:** The price is $p_2 = -\\$0.05$. This means you receive $0.05 to take on this position.\n*   **Future Payoff:** The security pays off $1 in the \u0027Bust\u0027 state and $0 in the \u0027Boom\u0027 state. The payoff vector is (0, 1), which is non-negative in all states.\n\nThis strategy involves receiving money upfront (negative cost) and facing no possibility of a future loss, with a potential for a future gain. This is a clear arbitrage opportunity.\n\n**Conclusion:** Even though the Law of One Price holds because every payoff has a unique price, the market is not free of arbitrage due to the presence of an asset with a negative price and non-negative payoffs."

Let $q_1$ be the free parameter.\n- $q_3 = q_1$\n- $q_2 = 1 - 2q_1$\n\nThe one-dimensional family of state-price vectors is $(q_1, 1-2q_1, q_1)$.\n\n**Step 3: Apply the positivity constraints to find the range for the free parameter $q_1$.**\nFor the absence of arbitrage, all state prices must be positive:\n1.  $q_1 \u003e 0$\n2.  $q_2 \u003e 0 \\implies 1 - 2q_1 \u003e 0 \\implies 1 \u003e 2q_1 \\implies q_1 \u003c 1/2$\n3.  $q_3 \u003e 0 \\implies q_1 \u003e 0$ (This is the same as the first constraint)\n\nCombining these constraints, the permissible range for $q_1$ is $0 \u003c q_1 \u003c 1/2$.\n\n**Step 4: Determine the corresponding range for $q_2$.**\nWe know that $q_2 = 1 - 2q_1$. We can find the bounds for $q_2$ by evaluating it at the bounds for $q_1$.\n- When $q_1$ approaches its lower bound of 0, $q_2$ approaches $1 - 2(0) = 1$.\n- When $q_1$ approaches its upper bound of 1/2, $q_2$ approaches $1 - 2(1/2) = 1 - 1 = 0$.\n\nTherefore, the permissible range for $q_2$ is $0 \u003c q_2 \u003c 1$.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe permissible range for the state price of state 2 is $(0, 1)$.

Therefore, Portfolio A represents an arbitrage opportunity that cannot exist if the proposed SDF correctly prices all assets.\n\n**Analysis of Portfolio B:**\n\n1.  **Check Arbitrage Conditions based on Market Data:**\n    *   (i) Price: $p_B = 5$. This is greater than zero ($p \u003e 0$), so it does not satisfy the price condition for an arbitrage.\n    *   Therefore, Portfolio B is not an arbitrage opportunity.\n\n2.  **Check Consistency with the SDF Model (for completeness):**\n    We calculate the theoretical price of Portfolio B.\n    $$ p_{B, model} = E[\\tilde{m}\\tilde{x}_B] = (0.25)(1.2)(5) + (0.50)(0.9)(5) + (0.25)(0.6)(5) $$\n    $$ p_{B, model} = 1.5 + 2.25 + 0.75 = 4.5 $$\n\n3.  **Conclusion for Portfolio B:** The model predicts a price of \\$4.5 while the market price is \\$5. The portfolio is mispriced (overpriced) according to the model, but it is not an arbitrage opportunity.\n\n**Final Answer:** Portfolio A is a clear arbitrage opportunity. This case demonstrates the core principle: if a strictly positive SDF exists and correctly prices all assets, portfolios like A cannot exist in the market, as their theoretical price must be positive."

However, because the SDF is high in bad states and low in good states, it is negatively correlated with efficient portfolios. This places the \u0027SDF Portfolio\u0027 on the **inefficient** part of the frontier (the lower half).\n\nThe risk-return coordinates for these two portfolios can be calculated using the market\u0027s maximum Sharpe Ratio (SR) and the risk-free rate ($R_f$):\n\n**Formula 1 (Tangency Portfolio):**\n*   Expected Return: $E[R_{tan}] = R_f + SR^2$\n*   Standard Deviation: $\\sigma_{tan} = SR$\n\n**Formula 2 (SDF Portfolio):**\n*   Expected Return: $E[R_{sdf}] = R_f - SR^2$\n*   Standard Deviation: $\\sigma_{sdf} = SR$\n\nYour firm\u0027s capital market assumptions are as follows:\n*   Risk-Free Rate ($R_f$): 2.0% (or 1.02 as a gross return)\n*   Maximum Sharpe Ratio (SR): 0.45",
        "question": "Calculate the expected return and standard deviation for both the Tangency Portfolio and the SDF Portfolio. Based on these coordinates, explain why the SDF portfolio is considered \u0027inefficient\u0027.",
        "answer": "We will calculate the risk-return coordinates for each portfolio using the provided formulas and market data.\n\n**Market Data:**\n*   $R_f = 1.02$\n*   $SR = 0.45$\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the coordinates for the Tangency Portfolio.**\nUsing **Formula 1**:\n*   **Standard Deviation:**\n    $\\sigma_{tan} = SR = 0.45$ or 45.0%\n*   **Expected Return:**\n    $E[R_{tan}] = R_f + SR^2 = 1.02 + (0.45)^2 = 1.02 + 0.2025 = 1.2225$\n    This corresponds to an expected return of 22.25%.\n\nSo, the Tangency Portfolio has coordinates ($\\sigma=45.0\\%$, $E[R]=22.25\\%$).\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the coordinates for the SDF Portfolio.**\nUsing **Formula 2**:\n*   **Standard Deviation:**\n    $\\sigma_{sdf} = SR = 0.45$ or 45.0%\n*   **Expected Return:**\n    $E[R_{sdf}] = R_f - SR^2 = 1.02 - (0.45)^2 = 1.02 - 0.2025 = 0.8175$\n    This corresponds to an expected return of -18.25%.\n\nSo, the SDF Portfolio has coordinates ($\\sigma=45.0\\%$, $E[R]=-18.25\\%$).\n\n**Step 3: Compare the portfolios and explain inefficiency.**\nBoth the Tangency Portfolio and the SDF Portfolio have the exact same standard deviation (risk) of 45.0%. However, their expected returns are dramatically different:\n*   Tangency Portfolio E[R]: +22.25%\n*   SDF Portfolio E[R]: -18.25%\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe SDF portfolio is considered \u0027inefficient\u0027 because for the same level of risk (45% standard deviation), it offers a substantially lower expected return than the Tangency Portfolio. A rational, risk-averse investor would never choose the SDF portfolio over the Tangency Portfolio. The SDF portfolio represents the worst possible return for that level of risk on the frontier, placing it squarely on the inefficient (lower) half of the mean-variance hyperbola."

In this case, both portfolios offered the same expected wealth of 110.

Yes, it is.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion and Economic Intuition\n**Conclusion:** Since the condition $\\zeta \u003e w_0 R_f$ is met, the client **will choose a mean-variance efficient portfolio**.\n\n**Economic Intuition:** The bliss point (味 = $12M) represents the level of wealth at which the client is fully satiated. The client\u0027s current wealth, even if invested risk-free, will only grow to $10.5M. Since this certain outcome is below their satiation level, the client still has an incentive to increase their expected wealth. To achieve a higher expected wealth (and thus move closer to their bliss point), they must take on risk. A rational investor will only take on risk if they are compensated with higher expected returns. Portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a given level of risk are, by definition, on the efficient frontier.

        "answer": "### Step 1: State the Objective and Formula\nThe objective is to calculate the second moment for each of the three candidate portfolios using the formula $E[\\tilde{R}^2] = \\text{var}(\\tilde{R}) + (E[\\tilde{R}])^2$ and identify the portfolio with the minimum value.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Second Moment for Portfolio A\nFor Portfolio A:\n*   $E[\\tilde{R}_A] = 0.08$\n*   $\\text{var}(\\tilde{R}_A) = 0.0256$\n\n$E[\\tilde{R}_A^2] = 0.0256 + (0.08)^2$\n$E[\\tilde{R}_A^2] = 0.0256 + 0.0064$\n$E[\\tilde{R}_A^2] = 0.0320$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Second Moment for Portfolio B\nFor Portfolio B:\n*   $E[\\tilde{R}_B] = 0.05$\n*   $\\text{var}(\\tilde{R}_B) = 0.0125$\n\n$E[\\tilde{R}_B^2] = 0.0125 + (0.05)^2$\n$E[\\tilde{R}_B^2] = 0.0125 + 0.0025$\n$E[\\tilde{R}_B^2] = 0.0150$\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Second Moment for Portfolio C\nFor Portfolio C:\n*   $E[\\tilde{R}_C] = 0.12$\n*   $\\text{var}(\\tilde{R}_C) = 0.0400$\n\n$E[\\tilde{R}_C^2] = 0.0400 + (0.12)^2$\n$E[\\tilde{R}_C^2] = 0.0400 + 0.0144$\n$E[\\tilde{R}_C^2] = 0.0544$\n\n### Step 5: Compare the Results and Conclude\nNow, we compare the calculated second moments for the three portfolios:\n*   Second Moment of A = 0.0320\n*   Second Moment of B = 0.0150\n*   Second Moment of C = 0.0544\n\nThe lowest value among the three is 0.0150, which corresponds to Portfolio B.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the calculations, **Portfolio B is the minimum second-moment return portfolio** because it has the smallest expected squared return ($E[\\tilde{R}^2]$) of 0.0150."

        "text": "You are an analyst on a quantitative research team that is backtesting a new asset pricing model based on the Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF). The team has constructed a candidate SDF from two fundamental portfolios derived from the asset universe. Before deploying the model more broadly, they need to verify that this candidate SDF correctly prices assets.\n\nYour task is to verify if the team\u0027s proposed random variable, $\\tilde{x}$, is a valid Stochastic Discount Factor. You will do this by checking if it correctly prices a test asset, \u0027Asset Z\u0027. According to asset pricing theory, for $\\tilde{x}$ to be a valid SDF, the condition $E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}] = 1$ must hold for any asset return $\\tilde{R}$.\n\nThe core of modern asset pricing is the Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF), often denoted $\\tilde{m}$ or $\\tilde{x}$. A random variable $\\tilde{x}$ is a valid SDF if, for any gross return $\\tilde{R}$ of a traded asset, it satisfies the pricing equation in **Formula 1**:\n\n**Formula 1:**\n$$ E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}] = 1 $$\n\nYour team has constructed a candidate SDF, $\\tilde{x}$, and has provided its realized values across three possible future states of the economy (State 1, State 2, State 3), which are assumed to be equally likely (i.e., probability of each state is 1/3).\n\nYou are also given the realized gross returns for a test asset, \u0027Asset Z\u0027, in each of these states.\n\n**Table 1: Realized Values**\n| State | Probability | SDF Value ($\\tilde{x}$) | Asset Z Return ($\\tilde{R}_Z$) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | 1/3 | 1.20 | 0.90 |\n| 2 | 1/3 | 0.95 | 1.00 |\n| 3 | 1/3 | 0.70 | 1.40 |",
        "question": "Using the data in **Table 1** and the pricing condition in **Formula 1**, calculate the expected value of the product of the candidate SDF and the return of Asset Z, $E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}_Z]$. Based on your result, determine whether the proposed $\\tilde{x}$ is a valid Stochastic Discount Factor for Asset Z.",
        "answer": "### Step 1: Understand the Calculation for Expected Value\nThe expected value of a random variable is the sum of the product of each possible value and its probability. In this case, we need to calculate $E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}_Z]$. The formula for this calculation is:\n\n$E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}_Z] = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} P(State_i) \\times \\tilde{x}(State_i) \\times \\tilde{R}_Z(State_i)$\n\nWhere $P(State_i)$ is the probability of State i, $\\tilde{x}(State_i)$ is the value of the SDF in State i, and $\\tilde{R}_Z(State_i)$ is the return of Asset Z in State i.\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Product for Each State\nUsing the data from Table 1, we first calculate the product $\\tilde{x} \\times \\tilde{R}_Z$ for each state:\n\n*   **State 1:** $1.20 \\times 0.90 = 1.08$\n*   **State 2:** $0.95 \\times 1.00 = 0.95$\n*   **State 3:** $0.70 \\times 1.40 = 0.98$\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Expected Value\nNow, we multiply each product by its probability (1/3) and sum the results:\n\n$E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}_Z] = (1/3 \\times 1.08) + (1/3 \\times 0.95) + (1/3 \\times 0.98)$\n$E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}_Z] = 1/3 \\times (1.08 + 0.95 + 0.98)$\n$E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}_Z] = 1/3 \\times (3.01)$\n$E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}_Z] \\approx 1.0033$\n\n### Step 4: Compare with the Theoretical Condition and Conclude\nThe fundamental condition for $\\tilde{x}$ to be a valid SDF is that $E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}]$ must equal exactly 1.\n\nOur calculated value is $E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}_Z] \\approx 1.0033$.\n\nWhile this value is very close to 1, it is not exactly 1. In the precise world of quantitative finance, this small deviation means the condition is not met.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the calculation, $E[\\tilde{x}\\tilde{R}_Z] \\approx 1.0033$, which is not equal to 1. Therefore, the proposed random variable $\\tilde{x}$ **is not a valid Stochastic Discount Factor** for Asset Z. It fails to price the asset correctly, indicating a flaw in the model\u0027s construction or the data used."
