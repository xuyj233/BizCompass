    "Options": "A. The price of the underlying moves in a continuous fashion B. The interest rate changes randomly over time C. The instantaneous variance of the return of the underlying is constant D. Markets are perfect, i.e. short sales are allowed, there are no transaction costs or taxes; and markets operate continuously",
    "Answer": "B",

    "Options": "A. The one-day USD VaR computed using the dollar return of the Carpathia USD 9 $3 / 8\\%$ 11 bond is an unbiased estimate of the risk of the Carpathia EUR $6\\%$ 07 in dollars B. The one-day VaR for the Carpathia EUR $6\\%$ 07 bond using daily indicative bid prices for the bond is an upward-biased estimate of the risk of the bond because the bid-ask spread on an illiquid bond is large C. It is more appropriate to estimate the VaR of the Carpathia EUR bond using a mix of bonds to account for errors in the bond prices than just using the EUR bond D. Unless a EUR futures position and a long position in the Carpathia USD bond replicate the Carpathia EUR bond, the VaR for the EUR bond should be computed over a multiple day horizon to account for illiquidity",
    "Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "# The traditional VAR models are, by construction, static. Increasing the risk horizon from one day to multiple days does not make the model static. Additionally, traditional VAR models assume to use market data from liquid markets. Liquidity risk cannot be factored into a traditional VAR model. Thus, unless the EUR bond can be replicated by a liquid EUR futures position and a long position in the $93 / 8\\%$ 11 bond (both of which are liquid assets), dynamic VAR must be used."

    "Options": "A. The relationship remains the same B. S increases relative to J C. J increases relative to S D. The effect cannot be determined given the data supplied",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "# If the default correlations are initially all 1.0, then the only possible outcomes are that all issuers default at once, or no issuers default. Given the zero recovery assumption, a default would then affect the junior and senior tranches equally. Therefore the spreads on the junior and senior tranches would be identical (50bps and 50bps, since the total spread across the entire basket must be equal to the 100bps spread of all individual reference credits). If the correlation is reduced below 1.0 to 0.70, there are some outcomes where only some issuers default; these cases will impact the junior tranche more than the senior tranche. However, the overall average default rate remains the same. This means that at a correlation less than 1.0, the junior tranche bears more of the risk than the senior tranche. Therefore, the spread on the junior tranche will increase relative to that of the senior tranche, because the total spread across the entire basket must remain 100bps. The correct choice is C."

    "Explanation": "# 'A' is incorrect. Asset liquidity risk arises when transactions cannot be conducted at quoted market prices due to the size of the required trade relative to normal trading costs. 'B' is incorrect. Flight to quality occurs when there is a shift in demand away from low- grade securities towards high- grade securities. The low grade market then becomes illiquid with depressed prices.

    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "# The correct answer is 'C', an interest- only tranche of a CMO transaction. An I- O tranche has negative duration because a decline in interest rates causes the I- O price to fall. As rates fall and mortgages begin to prepay, the flows of an I- O tranche vanish. (Whenever some of the principal is paid- off there is less available from which to collect interest.) When rates are very high and prepayments are low, the I- O is like a security with a fixed set of cash flows. It has greater notional amount based on which interest will be calculated. The price of an interest- only tranche will most likely increase as interest rate increases, leading to a negative effective duration.

    "Answer": "B",
    "Explanation": "# 'A' is incorrect. Entering into a pay fixed swap will further reduce the duration of the assets. This will exacerbate the interest rate risk arising from the duration mismatch. 'B' is correct. Because the duration of the pension liabilities exceeds the duration of the bond portfolio (assets), the pension plan is at risk if interest rates fall. Specifically, in a falling rate environment, the value of the liabilities will increase by more than will the value of the assets, thereby eroding the pension surplus. The duration of a swap equals the difference between the duration of the fixed leg and the duration of the floating leg. By entering into a receive- fixed swap, the pension plan can increase the portfolio duration to equal that of the pension liabilities and consequently reduce interest rate risk. 'C' is incorrect.

    "Options": "A. Credit card debt B. Residential mortgage debt C. Commercial real estate D. Hospital receivables",
    "Answer": "B",
    "Explanation": "Prepayment risk most often arises in the context of home mortgages when there is uncertainty as to whether a homeowner will repay and refinance the mortgage early. Prepayment risks are an important feature of mortgage backed securities, where the investor has granted the borrower the option to prepay the mortgage early. Residential mortgages are subject to the greatest prepayment risk. This option is a complex option to value because it depends on the age of the loan, spread between mortgage rate and current interest rates, refinancing incentives, economic activities and seasonal factors. Therefore, pricing models for residential mortgage debt are very dependent on prepayment assumptions and models."

    "Options": "A. USD 219 million B. USD 195 million C. USD 209 million D. USD 206 million",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "To calculate the best estimate of the market value of the portfolio if interest rates decline 0.5%, one needs to calculate the change in the market value of each bond using duration. The duration of the 10- year zero coupon bond is 10. Thus, the change in value of this bond equals 10x0.005x100,000,000, which equals 5 million dollars. The duration of the newly issued 6% bond is 7.802 assuming that the price of the bond is par. Given a duration of 7.802, the change in the value of the bond equals 7.802x0.005x100,000,000, which equals 3.91 million.

    "Explanation": "# Vega measures the sensitivity of the option price to the underlying asset's volatility. The most sensitive area for the option is close to the money. When the option is out of the money or way in the money, it has little sensitivity to changes in underlying risk. This relation occurs because when the option is way out of the money it has to move a long way before it ever pays off. Similarly, when the option is way in the money, it has to move a long way before it is worthless. When the option underlying price is close to the strike price, whether the option will be worth something at expiration is uncertain. So, its sensitivity to changes in volatility increases.

    "Options": "A. The amount of risk capital required for this bond by the bank necessarily increases if the volatility of the assets of the issuer increases B. The amount of risk capital required for this bond exhibits a hump shape - it first increases with asset volatility and then falls C. The shape of the relation between the amount of risk capital and asset volatility cannot be determined without knowing the bank's RAROC hurdle rate D. The shape of the relation between the amount of risk capital and asset volatility cannot be determined without knowing the confidence level at which the bank's credit-var is calculated",
    "Answer": "B",
    "Explanation": "A risky bond can be decomposed into a risk- free bond and a put option. The price of the bond equals the price of the default free bond minus the put option premium. As the asset volatility increases, the put premium will increase and the price of the risky bond will fall. Thus, a bond issued by a firm with extremely high asset volatility will be almost worthless, so that it requires little capital."

A holder of a reverse floater can synthetically convert his position into a fixed rate bond by receiving floating and paying fixed on an interest rate swap C. A reverse floater hedges against rising benchmark yields D. A reverse floater's price changes by as much as that in a similar maturity fixed rate bond for a given change in yield",
    "Answer": "B",
    "Explanation": "A reverse floater (or an inverse floater) is a floater whose coupon fluctuates inversely with its reference rate- increasing when the reference rate decreases and decreasing when the reference rate increases. With each coupon payment, the floating rate is reset for the next period according to the formula: floating rate $=$ fixed rate - (coupon leverage)x(reference rate). The multiplier is called the coupon leverage. Often, it is equal to 1, but not always. If it exceeds 1, the instrument is called a leveraged inverse floater. 'A' is not correct. Reverse floaters carry much higher duration risk than simple floaters that carry negligible duration risk. 'C' is not correct. A reverse floater hedges against falling and not rising benchmark yields. 'D' is not correct. The duration of a reverse floater is much more than that of a similar maturity fixed rate bond. 'B' is correct. The net impact of the reverse floater and the receive- floating, pay- fixed swap would be to cancel the floating leg (the investor pays floating in the floater but receives floating in the swap), leaving the investor with a fixed rate bond carrying a net coupon equal to the difference between the fixed rate in the reverse floater and fixed rate in the swap."

Thus, the issuer will \"call\" back the bond. 'B' is correct. The issuance of callable bond is equivalent to a short position in a straight bond plus a long call option on the bond price. 'C' is correct. The put feature will make the bond more attractive to investors, increasing its price and lowering its yield. 'D' is correct.

    "Options": "A. I and III B. II and IV C. II, III and IV D. I, II, III and IV",
    "Answer": "B",
    "Explanation": "Bonds are balance sheet assets whose current and potential credit exposure is the amount that is loaned. The credit exposure of an interest rate swap (IRS) is a small fraction of the credit exposure due to a bond with the same principal. The principal amount of the swap is not at risk (notional amounts are not exchanged). The full value of the coupons is not at risk as only the net difference between the fixed and floating coupons is exchanged. The swap can lead to a loss only if the default occurs when the contract is in the money and has positive value (a bond always has a positive value). Moreover, many of the regular counter- parties in the swaps market have netting agreements that reduce the credit exposure even further by setting off swaps that have positive value (for the non- defaulting party) with those that have negative values.

    "Options": "A. 0.083 B. 0.2166 C. 0.6826 D. 0.7494",

    "Explanation": "Let A be the event that z takes a value between 1 and $^{- 1}$ and B be the event that z takes a value greater than 11/2 . The probability of z being between 1 and $^{- 1}$ is the area under the standard normal curve between 1 and - 1. From the properties of a standard normal distribution, we know that: $$ N(-1) = 1.0 - N(1) = 1.0 - 0.8413 = 0.1587 $$ Therefore, the probability of z being between 1 and $- 1 = P(A) = N(1) - N(- 1) = 0.6826$ The probability of z being greater than $11 / 2 = P(B) = 1 - N(11 / 2) = N(- 11 / 2) = 0.0668$ Event $X = A$ U B and $P(X) = P(A) + P(B)$ since A and B are mutually exclusive.

    "Explanation": "The Standardized approach does not recognize diversification effects. Capital requirements under Internal Rating Based (IRB) approach are modified to reflect the overall diversification or \"granularity\" in a bank's loan portfolio. The granularity adjustments construct a specific regulatory measure of diversification of a bank's portfolio. This measure is then used to increase or decrease the baseline IRD regulatory capital requirements. If the regulatory diversification measure indicates that a portfolio is well (poorly) diversified, the granularity adjustment decreases (increases) regulatory capital from the IRB baseline.

There are currently two scenarios for the yield curve: the first scenario is an upward shift of 25 bps, with the second scenario a downward shift of 25 bps.

    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "The impact of a change in the yield on the value of the assets or liabilities is given by: So, in the first scenario (yield shifts upward by 25 bps), asset and liability values would decrease in value: delta(assets) = - 4,000,000,000 * 8.254 * 0.0025 = - 82,540,000 delta(liabilities) = - 5,000,000,000 * 6.825 * 0.0025 = - 85,312,500 Since the liability decrease is greater, nothing should be done. In the second scenario (yield shifts downward by 25 bps), asset and liability values would increase by 82,540,000 and 85,312,500, respectively, which would widen the pension fund gap so some hedging would be needed. The amount to be hedged is 85,312,500 - 82,540,000 = 2,772,500. Since the futures contract would increase in value as the yield shifts downward, Albert should BUY these contracts and the number to buy is given by: $$ N = 2,772,500 / (-68,336 * 2.1468 * -0.0025) = 7,559 $$"

The PAC's prepayment option is analogous to a put option as it offers protection to investorsIII. The PAC is priced at the same spread to Treasuries as its companion bondsIV.

    "Options": "A. I and IIIb. I and IVc. II, III and IVd. II and III",
    "Answer": "B",
    "Explanation": "Option (I) is correct in that PAC's provide the benefit of a steady expected stream of payments and their companion bonds absorb the risk of prepayment outside the bands, and option (IV) is correct in that a \"drift\" effect on the bands will take place if the prepayment rate is outside the band over a long period of time. How far apart the bands are set is irrelevant to this concept. The drift arises due to the interaction between the actual cash prepayments and the bands and the changes in collateral balance and the ratio between the PAC and companion nominal values. Option (II) is not correct in that the prepayment option is similar to a call, not a put, and option (III) is not correct in that companion bonds are priced at a higher spread to Treasuries because of their higher prepayment risk and PACs are priced at a lower spread to Treasuries since the prepayment risk is transferred to the companion bond."

Further, the mean, not the median, measures the center of gravity of a population, and a leptokurtic distribution has kurtosis greater than 3, which means it is more fat- tailed than the normal distribution."

If the relative change in yield levels between these two instruments captured by the yield beta is 0.87, which of the following more accurately describes the hedging strategy?",
    "Options": "A. The 10-year bond is more sensitive to interest rate changes than the 20-year bond. B. Shorting the equivalent amount of par value of the 10-year bond for every USD 1 par of the 20-year bond constitutes a perfect hedge. C.

Theta is large and negative for an at-the-money European-styled option, whilst theta is close to zero when the price for the underlying stock is very low. Therefore the theta for an out-of-the-money European styled call option would have a lower negative value compared to that of an at-the-money European-styled call option."

    "Question": "You are being interviewed for the position of CRO for a large fund-of-funds. You are asked to comment on the risk management approach of the CRO you would replace, James Smith, and who just left to start his own fund-of-funds. To evaluate the risk of a hedge fund that invests in U.S. equities over the coming month, Smith proceeded as follows. Using monthly data, he would regress, using ordinary least-squares, the return of the fund over its history on the return of the S&P 500, the return of a portfolio long growth stocks and short value stocks, and the return of a portfolio long large firms and short small firms. He would then use an EWMA model to forecast volatilities and correlations for the risk factors. Using the exposures of the fund to the risk factors and the standard deviation of the residual of the regression, he would then forecast the volatility of the fund and use the parametric approach assuming normally distributed returns to estimate the one-month VaR of the fund. Which of the following statements are correct? I. The well-known work of Fama and French tells us that Smith uses an appropriate risk model, so that the risk factors do not need to be changed. However, his approach makes the mistake of ignoring the fact that hedge fund returns are not normally distributed. The correct distribution of the residual should have higher kurtosis than the normal distribution. II. The estimates of the exposures to the risk factors will often be biased since the returns of many hedge funds exhibit high serial correlation compared to the returns of mutual funds. III. The model used by Smith will have low explanatory power because hedge funds change exposures to the risk factors he uses often, but the explanatory power could be improved by using additional asset based factors that have been developed in the literature. IV. Since portfolio holdings for the typical hedge fund change so much, it is hopeless to hope to explain more than a trivial faction of the return of a typical hedge fund using a factor model.",

Incorrect. The risk model used is not one that captures the nonlinear exposures of hedge funds. B. Correct.

In the case of a first- to- default swap, a credit event occurs the first time any of the entities defaults. This swap provides default protection against losses related to this first default, but not to any subsequent defaults. Thus, the question is whether the level of correlation between assets of the basket increases or decreases the likelihood of the triggering event. If the correlation between the assets in a credit basket swap is lower, the basket would be exposed to greater default risk. For example, the basket contains assets from different sectors, then the basket would be exposed to the default risk of each and every sector in the basket. If the basket only contains assets from one sector, then the correlation is higher, and the default risk is lower.Reference: Hull, 22, 23 Reference:Hull,22,23",

The bank decides to model teller operational risk events as a Poisson Process with rate $\\lambda$ (number of events per year). With this model, teller operational risk events are assumed to occur independently of one another and the number of teller operational risk events in a year is Poisson distributed with mean $\\lambda$ . Other properties of a Poisson distribution with mean $\\lambda$ include: Variance: $\\lambda$ Skewness: $\\lambda^{- 0.5}$ Excess kurtosis $1 / \\lambda$ Based on historical data regarding the number of teller operational risk events that occurred in previous years, the bank determines that the average number of events has been 5 per year and decides to set $\\lambda$ to 5.

The number of teller operational risk events in a year cannot exceed 25.",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "The Poisson model implies that teller events are independent of one another. INCORRECT: A - The teller operational risk event has a variance of 5.

An individual shows up at a branch presenting a check written by a customer for an amount substantially exceeding the customers low checking account balance. When the bank calls the customer to ask him for the funds, the phone is disconnected and the bank cannot recover the funds. C. During an adverse market movement, the computer network system becomes overwhelmed and only intermittent pricing information is available to the bank's trading desk, leading to large losses as traders become unable to alter their hedges in response to falling prices D. A bank, acting as a trustee for a loan pool, receives less than the projected funds due to delayed repayment of certain loans.",
    "Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "A broad interpretation of the FDIC and Basel II rules defining operational risks would consider all, but alternative d, as operational risk events and operational risk losses. A loan officer entering inaccurate client financial information into the bank's proprietary credit risk model is a process risk and any losses attributable to this employee error should be considered as an operational risk event. Customers writing checks exceeding the balance of a checking account and depositing the funds in a savings account is an example of check kiting. If during times of adverse market movement, the computer network becomes overwhelmed and only delayed pricing information reaches the bank's trading desk and trades are based on the available information, the bank is subject to business disruption and system failures. When a bank, acting as a trustee for a loan pool, receives less than the projected funds due to delayed repayment of certain loans in the pool is not an operational risk loss event."

Which of the following statements is least likely to be correct?",
    "Options": "A. Andromeda is a passively managed fund. B. The pension fund should invest in the Borealis fund because it has the highest Sharpe ratio. C. Crux's investment style has drifted to small-capitalization. D. Draco has the highest Information Ratio.",
    "Answer": "B",
    "Explanation": "Choice a: The high R2 indicate low residuals, and the fund is probably being passively managed. Choice b: The Sharpe ratio is not the right metric in this context because a fund is added to an existing portfolio and the fund has to be a large cap fund. Choice c: Although Crux claims to be large- capitalization fund, its weight in Russell 2000 Value Index and Russell 2000 Growth Index sum up to over $60\\%$ . So style drifting occurs. Choice d: Information ratio = (fund return - S&P 500 return)/tracking error. Draco has the highest IR."

    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "Implementation risk refers to model risk pertinent to implementation, it assumes the model is correctly specified and calibrated. It usually pertains to valuation errors, e.g. mark to market vs. mark to model, usage of mid- quote vs. bid- ask spread, hence it corresponds to Risk 2. Incorrect model calibration risk refers to model risk pertinent to non- calibration or inaccurate calibration of (usually correctly specified) models under changing circumstances. An example is unexpected rise in volatility, causing banks to experience higher losses than suggested under original risk models (past cases include LTCM, Natwest, BZW and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi cases), hence it corresponds to risk 3. Incorrect model application risk refers to model risk pertinent to improper application of a risk model. An example is consideration of an insufficient number of trials in a Monte Carlo simulation.

However, top- down operational risk techniques tend to be of little use in designing procedures to reduce operational risk in any particularly vulnerable area of the firm. That is, they do not incorporate any adjustment for the implementation of operational risk controls, nor can they advise management about specific weak points in the production process.

    "Options": "A. Quadratic programming allows for risk control through parameter estimation but generally requires many more inputs estimated from market data than other methods require. B. The screening technique provides superior risk control by concentrating stocks in selected sectors based on expected alpha. C. When using the stratification technique, risk control is implemented by overweighting the categories with lower risks and underweighting the categories with higher risks. D. When using the linear programming technique, risk is controlled by selecting the portfolio with the lowest level of active risk.",
    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "Quadratic programming requires many more inputs than other portfolio construction techniques because it entails estimating volatilities and pair- wise correlations between all assets in a portfolio. Quadratic programming is a powerful process, but given the large number of inputs it introduces the potential for noise and poor calibration given the less than perfect nature of most data. On the other hand, the screening technique strives for risk control by including a sufficient number of stocks that meet the screening parameters and by weighting them to avoid concentrations in any particular stock. However, screening does not necessarily select stocks evenly across sectors and can ignore entire sectors or classes of stocks entirely if they do not pass the screen. Therefore, risk control in a screening process is fragmentary at best. Stratification separates stocks into categories (for example, economic sectors) and implements risk control by ensuring that the weighting in each sector matches the benchmark weighting. Therefore, it does not allow for overweighting or underweighting specific categories. Linear programming does not necessarily select the portfolio with the lowest level of active risk. Rather, it attempts to improve on stratification by introducing many more dimensions of risk control and ensuring that the portfolio approximates the benchmark for all these dimensions."

Because of the overwhelming importance of tail risk, the company should not invest in the fund unless it fully accounts for fat tails using extreme value theory at the $99.99\\%$ level when estimating VaR. B. Today's best practices in risk management require that a fund employ independent risk service providers and that these service providers play important roles in risk-related decisions. C.

It is crucial to assess the fund's valuation policy, and in general if more than $10\\%$ of asset prices are based on model prices or broker quotes, the specialist should recommend against investment in the fund regardless of other information available about the fund.",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "Generally speaking, with a leveraged fund, an investor will need to evaluate historical and current changes in leverage, as well as the level of liquidity of the portfolio, particularly during times of market stress. Certain strategies may in fact expose an investor to tail risk, so while an investor should inquire whether the manager believes that tail risk exists, and whether or not it is hedged, it is then up to the investor to decide whether to accept the risk unhedged or hedge it on their own. Many funds employ independent risk service providers to report risks to investors, but these firms do not get involved in risk related decision making.

When short-term rates are negative, the risk manager increases the volatility. D. When short-term rates are negative, the risk manager sets the rate to zero.",
    "Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "Negative short- term interest rates can arise in models for which the terminal distribution of interest rates follows a normal distribution. The existence of negative interest rates does not make much economic sense since market participants would generally not lend cash at negative interest rates when they can hold cash and earn a zero return. One method that can be used to address the potential for negative interest rates when constructing interest rate trees is to set all negative interest rates to zero. This localizes the change in assumptions to points in the distribution corresponding to negative interest rates and preserves the original rate tree for all other observations. In comparison, adjusting the risk neutral probabilities would alter the dynamics across the entire range of interest rates and therefore not be an optimal approach. When a model displays the potential for negative short- term interest rates, it can still be a desirable model to use in certain situations, especially in cases where the valuation depends more on the average path of the interest rate, such as in valuing coupon bonds. Therefore, the potential for negative rates does not automatically rule out the use of the model."

    "Explanation": "Expected shortfall is always greater than or equal to VaR for a given confidence level, since ES accounts for the severity of expected losses beyond a particular confidence level, while VaR measures the minimum expected loss at that confidence level.

In order to properly assess both right-way and wrong-way risk in stress environments, assumptions should be included that specifically benefit the BHC. D. When developing scenarios internally, it is acceptable to combine expert judgment with quantitative models rather than relying only on the models.",
    "Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "According to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, bank holding companies with superior scenario- design practices generally use a combination of internal models and expert judgment rather than relying solely on either practice by itself. This allows the BHC to tailor scenarios or quantitative models to its own unique risk profile and vulnerabilities. Therefore, combining expert judgment with quantitative models is clearly acceptable."

    "Options": "A. Delta-normal VaR is more appropriate than historical simulation VaR for assets with non-linear payoffs. B. Changing the look-back period and weighing scheme from three years, equally weighted, to four years, exponentially weighted, will understate the risk in the portfolio. C.

Comparing the two bonds, the X bond pays a higher coupon than the Z bond, yet it is cheaper as well. Therefore the yield on the X bond is higher.

    "Options": "A. Treynor ratio B. Sharpe ratio C. Jensen's alpha D. Sortino ratio",
    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "Systematic risk of a portfolio is that risk which is inherent in the market and thus cannot be diversified away. In this situation you should seek a measure which ranks funds based on systematic risk only, which is reflected in the beta as defined below: $\\beta_{\\mathsf{p}} = (\\rho_{\\mathsf{PM}} * \\sigma_{\\mathsf{p}} * \\sigma_{\\mathsf{M}}) / \\sigma^{2}$ where $\\rho_{\\mathsf{PM}}$ is the correlation coefficient between the portfolio and the market, $\\sigma_{\\mathsf{p}}$ represents the standard deviation of the portfolio and $\\sigma_{\\mathsf{M}}$ represents the standard deviation of the market. In a well- diversified portfolio (where one is normally only concerned with systematic risk), it can be assumed that the correlation coefficient is close to 1, therefore beta can be approximated to an even simpler equation: $$ \\beta_{\\mathsf{p}}\\approx \\sigma_{\\mathsf{p}} / \\sigma_{\\mathsf{M}} $$ In either case, beta explains the volatility of the portfolio compared to the volatility of the market, which captures only systematic risk."

    "Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "A major contributing factor to the collapse of LTCM is that it did not account properly for the illiquidity of its largest positions in its risk calculations. LTCM received valuation reports from dealers who only knew a small portion of LTCM's total position in particular securities, therefore understating LTCM's true liquidity risk. When the markets became unsettled due to the Russian debt crisis in August 1998 and a separate firm decided to liquidate large positions which were similar to many at LTCM, the illiquidity of LTCM's positions forced it into a situation where it was reluctant to sell and create an even more dramatic adverse market impact even as its equity was rapidly deteriorating. To avert a full collapse, LTCM's creditors finally stepped in to provide $3.65 billion in additional liquidity to allow LTCM to continue holding its positions through the turbulent market conditions in the fall of 1998.

These profits would dissipate as the bonds approached their delivery date, but Jett covered this up by rolling the positions forward with increasingly greater positions and longer lengths to delivery, which created a higher stream of hypothetical profits due to the accounting flaw. Finally this stream of large profits was investigated and Kidder Peabody was forced to take a USD 350 million accounting loss to reverse the reported gains, which resulted in a loss of confidence in the firm and General Electric's subsequent sale."

    "Answer": "D",

The no- arbitrage value of the futures contract can be calculated as the future value of the spot price: $S_0 * e^{(risk - free - dividend yield) \\times t}$ , where $S_0$ equals the current spot price and $t$ equals the time in years. Future value of the spot price $= S_0 * \\exp [(risk - free - dividend yield) * 1.25] = 3,763.52$ Since this value is different from the current futures contract price, a potential arbitrage situation exists. Since the futures price is higher than the future value of the spot price in this case, one can short sell the higher priced futures contract, and buy the underlying stocks in the index at the current price.

Implies that the option increases in value as market volatility increases.",
    "Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "The relationship between convexity and volatility for a security can be seen most clearly through the second- order Taylor approximation of the change in price given a small change in yield. The resulting change in price can be estimated as: $$ \\frac{\\Delta P}{P}\\approx -D\\Delta y + \\frac{1}{2} C\\Delta y^2 $$ where d is equal to the duration, c is the convexity and y is the change in the interest rate. Since $\\Delta y$ is always positive, positive convexity will lead to an increase in return as long as interest rates move, with larger interest moves in either direction leading to a greater return benefit from the positive convexity. Therefore, a position in a security with positive convexity can be considered a long position in volatility. This relationship can also be explained graphically. The price curve of a security with positive convexity will lie above and tangentially to the price curve of the underlying. If volatility of the underlying increases, then so will the volatility of either a long call or a long put, but the deviation from the price of the underlying will be positive when there is positive convexity, and negative with negative convexity. Therefore, the expected terminal value over the in- the- money region will increase while the expected terminal value over the out- of- the- money region will remain zero, an aggregate effect of increasing the total expected value of the option."

In the case that dividends are introduced, $S$ in the formula is reduced by the present value of the dividends. Furthermore, the announcement would affect the values of $S$ , $d_1$ and $d_2$ . However, since we are given the new values, and $d_2$ is the same, the change in the price of the call is only dependent on the term $S * N(d_1)$ .

Therefore a 1 point change in the index would translate to approximately $0.5 * \\text{EUR} 10 = \\text{EUR} 5$ change in the call value. Therefore, the percent delta, also known as the local delta, defined as $\\% \\text{D} = (5 / 350) / (1 / 2200) = 31.4$ .

Zero coupon bonds with long maturity will increase in value as interest rates fall, so calls on these bonds will increase in value as rates fall but puts on these bonds will decrease in value and this makes C the correct choice. Interest- only strips from long maturity conforming mortgages will decrease in value as interest rates fall, so puts on them will increase in value, while principal strips on these same mortgages will increase in value, so calls on them will also increase in value."

The company expects to receive this amount on Oct. 1, 2009. The CFO of XYZ wants to protect the value of this receivable. On April 1, 2009, the EUR spot rate is 1.34, and the 6-month EUR forward rate is 1.33. The CFO can lock in an exchange rate by taking a position in the forward contract. Alternatively, he can sell a 6-month EUR 5,000,000 call option with strike price of 1.34. The CFO thinks that selling an option is better than taking a forward position because if the EUR goes up, XYZ can take delivery of the USD at 1.34, which is better than the outright forward rate of 1.33. If the EUR goes down, the contract will not be exercised. So, XYZ will pocket the premium obtained from selling the call option. What can be concluded about the CFO's analysis?

    "Explanation": "The distribution of excess losses over u converges to a generalized Pareto distribution as the threshold value u increases. The distribution of X itself can be any of the commonly used distributions: normal, lognormal, t, etc., and will usually be unknown. The distribution of excess losses requires the estimation of two parameters, a positive scale parameter $\\beta$ and a shape or tail index parameter $\\xi$ . One must choose a threshold u that is high enough so that the theory applies but also low enough so that there are observations in excess of u."

Which of the following distribution characteristics would make parametric approaches the favored method to use?",
    "Options": "A. Skewness in the distribution B. Fat tails in the distribution C. Scarcity of high magnitude loss events D. Heteroskedasticity in the distribution",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "Non- parametric approaches can accommodate fat tails, skewness, and any other non- normal features that can cause problems for parametric approaches. However, if the data period that is used in estimation includes few losses or losses with low magnitude, non- parametric methods will often produce risk measures that are too low. Hence parametric methods would be more appropriate in those situations."

    "Explanation": "The key to CDS valuation is to equate the present value (PV) of payments to the PV of expected payoff in the event of default. Let: $\\mathsf{r} =$ risk- free rate $= 2.5\\%$ $\\mathsf{s} = \\mathsf{CDS}$ spread. $\\pi =$ probability of default during year $1 = 7\\%$ $\\mathbb{C} =$ contingent payment in case of default $= 80\\%$ $\\mathsf{d}_{0.5} =$ discount factor for half- year $= \\mathsf{e}^{- 0.5^{*}\\mathsf{r}} = \\mathsf{e}^{- 0.5^{*}0.025} = 0.$ $\\mathsf{d}_{1.0} =$ discount factor for 1- year $= \\mathsf{e}^{- 1.0^{*}\\mathsf{r}} = \\mathsf{e}^{- 0.025} = 0.$ Therefore, to solve for the CDS spread (s): The PV of payments (premium leg, which includes the spread payment and accrual) is: $\\mathsf{s}^{*}[0.5^{*}\\mathsf{d}_{0.5}^{*}\\pi +\\mathsf{d}_{1.0}^{*}(1 - \\pi)] = \\mathsf{s}^{*}[0. + 0.] = \\mathsf{s}^{*}0.$ The payoff leg (in the event of default) $= \\mathsf{C}^{*}\\mathsf{d}_{0.5}^{*}\\pi = 0.8^{*}0.^{*}0.07 = 0.$ Equating the two PVs and solving for the spread: $\\mathsf{s}^{*}0. = 0.$ Thus, $\\mathsf{s} = 0.$ or a spread of approximately 587 basis points."

In 2015, the widespread effects of the global energy crisis hit the pension fund, causing its investment in equities to lose $40\\%$ of their market value. In addition, the immediate response from the government  cutting interest rates  to salvage the situation, caused bond yields to decline by $1.8\\%$ . What was the change in the pension fund's surplus in 2015?",
    "Options": "A. USD -330.00 million B. USD -245.12 million C. USD -185.12 million D. USD -144.88 million",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "The change in the pension fund's surplus (S) for the year 2015 is equal to the ending surplus $(S_{1})$ at the end of 2015 less the initial surplus $(S_{0})$ at the end of 2014. That is, $\\Delta S = S_{1} - S_{0}$ . The initial surplus is calculated as $S_{0} = A_{0} - L_{0} = 650 - 320 = USD 330$ million, where $A_{0} =$ the firm's initial assets and $L_{0} =$ the firm's initial liabilities. Next we have to calculate $S_{1}$ , the surplus at the end of 2015. Given the $40\\%$ decline in the equity market, the new level of assets $A_{1}$ at the end of 2015 is equal to: $A_{1} = (1 - 0.4)^{*}650 = USD390$ million. Since the percentage change in liability value $= - D_{M}^{*}\\Delta y$ , where $\\mathsf{DM} =$ modified duration $= 13$ ; and $\\Delta \\gamma =$ change in yield $= - 1.8\\%$ , then the new level of liabilities $\\mathsf{L}_1$ at the end of 2015 can be calculated as: $$ \\mathsf{L}_1 = [1 - (D_{\\mathsf{M}}^*\\Delta \\mathsf{y})]^*\\mathsf{L}_0 = (1 - 13^* 0.018)^* 320 = \\mathsf{USD}245.12\\mathsf{million} $$ Thus, the ending surplus for $2015 = S_{1} = A_{1} - L_{1} = 390 - 245.12 = USD 144.88$ million Therefore the change in surplus for $2015 = \\Delta S = S_{1} - S_{0} = 144.88 - 330 = USD - 185.12$ million (which implies the pension fund is actually in a deficit situation at the end of 2015)."

The correlation between the returns of Stock A and Stock B is 0.4. While rebalancing, the portfolio manager decides to sell USD 1 million of Stock A to buy USD 1 million of Stock B. Assuming that returns are normally distributed and that the rebalancing does not affect the volatility of the individual stocks, what effect will this have on the $95\\%$ 1-day portfolio VaR?",
    "Options": "A. The portfolio VaR will not change. B. The portfolio VaR will increase by USD 20,370. C. The portfolio VaR will increase by USD 24,800. D. The portfolio VaR will increase by USD 28,281.",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "The first step is to calculate the VaR of the original portfolio of two stocks, A and B. This can be done by using the following equation: $$ V a R_{p} = \\sqrt{\\left(V a R_{A}^{2} + V a R_{B}^{2} + 2*\\rho_{A B}*\\mathsf{V}a R_{A}*\\mathsf{V}a R_{B}\\right)} $$ where $\\rho_{\\mathrm{AB}}$ is the correlation coefficient. The portfolio VaR (before the rebalancing) is therefore: $$ V a R_{p} = \\sqrt{\\left(70,000^{2} + 70,000^{2} + 2*0.4*70,000*70,000\\right)} = U S D117,132 $$ After the rebalance, the market value of the position in Stock A is reduced by one- third, so $\\mathsf{V}\\mathsf{a}\\mathsf{R}_{\\mathsf{A}}$ is now equal to $(2 / 3)^{*}($ 70,000) = \\ $46,667.

Hence we can now calculate the VaR of the new portfolio (after rebalancing) as follows: $$ V a R_{p} = \\sqrt{\\left(46,667^{2} + 116,667^{2} + 2*0.4*46,667*116,667\\right)} = U S D141,932 $$ Therefore, the VaR will increase by (141,932 - 117,132), or USD 24,800."

    "Answer": "B",
    "Explanation": "One of the key frictions in the process of securitization involves an information problem between the originator and arranger.

Without adequate safeguards in place, an originator can have the incentive to collabo- rate with a borrower in order to make significant misrepresentations on the loan application.

In this case, choice d is a coherent scenario since the country's economy depends heavily on exports of oil and natural gas, so therefore a sustained decrease in natural gas prices should lead to a decrease in stock prices as the domestic economy weakens. In stress testing banks, it is often challenging to develop scenarios where all factors behave coherently."

The company and a handful of other firms, all of whom have large notional outstanding contracts with the company, dominate the market for such derivatives. The company's management would like to mitigate its overall counterparty exposure, with the goal of reducing it to almost zero. Which of the following methods, if implemented, could best achieve this goal?",
    "Options": "A. Ensuring that sufficient collateral is posted by counterparties B. Diversifying among counterparties C. Cross-product netting on a single counterparty basis D. Purchasing credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps",
    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "Counterparty exposure, in theory, can be almost completely neutralized as long as a sufficient amount of high quality collateral, such as cash or short- term investment grade government bonds, is held against it. If the counterparty were to default, the holder of an open derivative contract with exposure to that counterparty would be allowed to receive the collateral. Cross- product netting would only reduce the exposure to one of the counter- parties, and purchasing credit derivatives would replace the counterparty risk from the individual counterparties with counterparty risk from the institution who wrote the CDS."

Recently, GXT Bank was downgraded from a rating of AA to a rating of A, while LEM Banking Corporation was downgraded from a rating of A to a rating of A-. During this time, the credit spread for GTX Bank has increased from 25 bps to 155 bps, while the credit spread for LEM Banking has increased from 120 bps to 160 bps. Which of the following is the most likely action that the counterparties will request on their credit value adjustment (CVA)?",
    "Options": "A. The credit qualities of the counterparties have migrated, but not significantly enough to justify amending existing CVA arrangements. B. GTX Bank requests an increase in the CVA charge it receives. C. LEM Banking Corporation requests a reduction in the CVA charge it pays. D. CVA is no longer a relevant factor, and the counterparties should migrate to using other mitigants of counterparty risk.",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "Because LEM Banking Corporation has a lower credit rating than GTX Bank, it would typically pay a CVA charge to GXT Bank which would be a function of the relative credit spread between the two banks. After the downgrades of both GTX Bank and LEM Banking Corporation y, the credit spread between the two firms narrowed from 95 bps initially to only 5 bps after the downgrades.

The total number of stocks is 100, so roughly there are 5 alphas that are out of the range."

    "Question": "A significant percentage of hedge funds stop trading each year and drop out of hedge fund databases. Which of the following best describes the impact this has historically had on hedge fund analyses performed using these databases?",
    "Options": "A. The average performance of hedge funds is overstated. B. The average volatility of hedge funds is overstated. C. The average correlation of hedge fund returns is overstated. D. The average Sharpe ratio of hedge fund returns is understated.",
    "Answer": "A",
    "Explanation": "As poor performers drop out of the database, the average performance increases. The removal of poor performers could actually reduce average volatility and the correlation of returns. The Sharpe ratio tends to get inflated due to survivorship bias."

    "Question": "A portfolio manager wants to invest a small amount of new money that has recently come into a fund. The fund is benchmarked to an index and, rather than adding a new holding, the manager is considering increasing the holdings of one of the four assets described in the following table: <table><tr><td>Asset</td><td>Portfolio Weight</td><td>Expected Return</td><td>Beta to the Index</td><td>Beta to the Portfolio</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>1.2%</td><td>12%</td><td>1.2</td><td>0.90</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>0.8%</td><td>10%</td><td>0.7</td><td>0.90</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>0.75</td><td>10%</td><td>0.6</td><td>0.85</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>0.35</td><td>8%</td><td>0.3</td><td>1.10</td></tr></table> The portfolio manager wants to select the asset that has the lowest marginal VaR as long as its Treynor ratio is at least 0.1. Assuming the risk free rate is $2\\%$ , which asset should the portfolio manager select?",
    "Options": "A. Asset A B. Asset B C. Asset C D. Asset D",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "# The Treynor measure is calculated as (Expected Return - Risk Free Rate)/Beta to Index. Assets B, C, D have Treynor measures greater than 0.1. Of these, C has the lowest marginal VaR as its Beta to the portfolio is the lowest."

    "Options": "A. The \"Minimum-Risk\" Decision Rule tries to minimize both type I and type II errors. B. The Neyman-Pearson rule minimizes type II error with type I error remaining constant. C. The Neyman-Pearson rule minimizes type I error with type II error remaining constant. D. The \"Minimum-Risk\" Decision Rule tries to minimize both credit and market risks.",
    "Answer": "C",
    "Explanation": "The Neyman- Pearson rule minimizes type I error with type II error remaining constant. There are four rules \"Minimum- Error\", \"Minimum- Risk\", Neyman- Pearson, and Minimax. The \"Minimum- Risk\" Decision Rule tries to minimize the risk of misclassification. It has nothing to do with market risk. Hence d is wrong."

    "Question": "A company's pension fund is established as a defined benefit plan, and therefore the board must consider funding risk. Which of the following statements about the pension fund's funding risk is correct?",
    "Options": "A. The longer the horizon for expected payouts, the lower the funding risk. B. Decreases in interest rates will reduce funding risk. C. The funding risk has been effectively transferred to the employees. D. Funding risk represents the true long-term risk to the plan sponsor.",
    "Answer": "D",
    "Explanation": "The time horizon of payouts does not eliminate funding risk. In fact it is the mismatch between assets and liabilities that creates funding risk. In an low interest rate environment the value of equities will rise, however the value of the liabilities are likely to increase more thereby exacerbating funding risk. Funding risk is transferred to employees with a defined contribution plan. Immunizing the portfolio, essentially matching duration of assets and liabilities, will reduce funding risk."
